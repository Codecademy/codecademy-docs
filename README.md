## What is Codepedia?
Codepedia is intended to be a free, easily accessible reference for coding terms and concepts available to learners the world over. If you forget what JavaScript hoisting is, we want you to be able to look up "JS hoisting" on any search engine, click a Codepedia entry as the first result, and have an answer in seconds.

To make the Codepedia vision clearer, [we even created a demo site](https://codecademy.github.io/codepedia/)! The UI is liable to change a lot, but the basic principles are there. 

## What stage of development are we in right now?
Right now we're trying to create a baseline of great content. We have an engineering team work on improving the UI of Codepedia in Q2, after which we'll put the content and the UI together and release to the world!


## What do I need to do before contributing? 
Before contributing, please read through the files in [/documentation](https://github.com/Codecademy/codepedia-content/tree/main/documentation). There you'll find a write-up of our standards for content and style, as well as templates for creating your entries. Next, check out what entries need to be created in [the assignment sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e31MNRVTo5VijcuPFjqWymw8_A1BbShGEW_LuCqXZZA/edit#gid=0) and put your name next to one.

## How do I contribute?
Contributing is as simple as forking this repo, editing your fork, and then making a pull request to merge your fork with this repo! If you haven't gone through this workflow before, you can check out [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgbCcBNZcdQ) to learn about how to make a pull request from a fork using Git. Alternatively, if you'd prefer to keep things to the GitHub UI for now, you can follow the instructions in that video up to 1:18 to fork this repo. After that, you can create your entry in your fork using the UI and then make a pull request by pressing this handy button:<br>

## Additional Notes
- Please prioritize all course and skill path work over Codepedia. Codepedia is a great way to fit in extra hours, but only when you don‚Äôt have higher priority work to do!
- Please use the ‚ÄôCodepedia‚Äù Boomr Project for time spent on this content.
- Remember, if you ever have any questions at all, we're there to help in #codepedia-production.
