[Carbon](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang) is an experimental successor to C++. C++ is difficult to learn and has accumulated decades of technical debt. However incrementally improving C++ is extremely difficult. Rather than attempt to incrementally evolve C++, Carbon is designed around [interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability) with C++. 

## Language Goals
- Performance-critical software
- Software and language evolution
- Code that is easy to read, understand, and write
- Practical safety and testing mechanisms
- Fast and scalable development
- Modern OS platforms, hardware architectures, and environments
- Interoperability with and migration from existing C++ code

Carbon is not ready for use... yet.
