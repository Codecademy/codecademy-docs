**Function as a service (FaaS)** is a cloud computing model that offers the ability to develop applications without building and maintaining the typical infrastructure needed for application development and deployment. The application functionality is developed and hosted on the cloud resulting in a "serverless" architecture. 

## History

FaaS was first offered by start-ups like PiCloud around 2010. It has since been offered by large vendors such as Google (Google Cloud Functions) and Microsoft (Microsoft Azure Functions).

## Advantages and Disadvantages

The main difference between FaaS and PaaS services is that FaaS services hide the server details from the user. The user is not paying for server processes being run on the cloud, but instead paying for function execution time. Because FaaS does not require a server process to be constantly run, the user does not pay for any process idle time. The disadvantage to this is that initial requests might take several seconds to respond (though caching may reduce subsequent requests to milliseconds). The advantage is a lower cost and higher scalability.
