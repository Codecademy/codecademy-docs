There are many different cloud-computing services, but the big three are Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). All three offer services to cover many of the most significant cloud-computing needs:

- [Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cloud-computing/iaas)
- [Platform as a service (PaaS)](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cloud-computing/paas)
- [Function as a service (FaaS)]((https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cloud-computing/faas)
- [Software as a service (SaaS)]((https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cloud-computing/saas)

## AWS

AWS is the largest cloud computing platform, and the most mature, introducing its first public cloud services in 2006. It serves millions of users, from individuals to large enterprises, to governments. With more than 200 services to its customers, AWS has the largest catalog of services of the big three. As of 2021 it has 25 geographic regions and 218+ edge locations. AWS tends to land near the middle of on-demand pricing.

The advantages of AWS include:

- The widest array of services; from networking to quantum computing.
- The most mature, reliable and secure platform.
- The most compute capability.
- All major software vendors make their products available on AWS.

Disadvantages include:

- Users must purchase Dev/Enterprise support.
- The number of services and options can be overwhelming.
- There are limited options to run a [hybrid cloud](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cloud-computing/types-of-cloud) solution.

## Azure

Azure is the second largest cloud platform, introduced my Microsoft in 2008. It is also currently among the fastest growing cloud platforms. It also has more than 200 products and services, a wide array of which are tailored to Microsoft-centric enterprises, providing an easier transition for many enterprises to a cloud or hybrid-cloud environment. In addition to Microsoft products, it also supports [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source) languages, technologies and platforms. As of 2021 it has 60+ geographic regions with 116 edge locations. It has the broadest geographic reach of the three platforms. It also tends to have the lowest on-demand pricing, particularly for enterprise users already using Microsoft services such as Windows, Active Directory and SQL Server.

The advantages of Azure include:

- The ease of integration and migration for existing Microsoft users.
- Best-in-class [AI](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/artificial-intelligence), [machine learning](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/machine-learning) and analytics services.
- More inexpensive for most services compared to AWS & GCP.
- Significant support for hybrid cloud solutions.

Disadvantages include:

- Fewer service offerings than AWS.
- Predominantly supports enterprise customers.

## GCP

GCP was introduced by Google in 2010 and is the smallest of the big three cloud-computing platforms. It offers the smallest catalog of services of the big three, but still offers over 100 services including computing, networking and [big data](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/big-data). Services include Google Workspace, enterprise Android, and Chrome OS. As of 2021 it has 27 geographic regions and 146 edge locations.

The advantages of GCP include:

- Easily integrates with other Google products and services.
- Global fiber network.
- Excellent integrations with open-source projects and third-party services.

The disadvantages include:

- Limited services compared to AWS & Azure.
- Limited support for enterprise users.
