The **shared responsibility model** means that cloud providers maintain some responsibility for security, but some security responsibilities are borne by the customer. In order to provide a secure environment using cloud services, the customer must be cognizant of where the provider's responsibilities end, and where their own responsibilities start.

The line between customer and provider responsibilities can vary between service providers, and can change depending on what type of service is being provided. For instance, the responsibilities may differ between [infrastructure as a service (IaaS)](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cloud-computing/iaas) and [platform-as-a-service (PaaS)](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cloud-computing/paas).

- AWS claims security responsibiliy for "protecting the hardware, software, networking and facilities that run AWS Cloud services."
- Microsoft Azure claims security responsibility over "physical hosts, networks, and data centers."

Both maintain that the customer's retained responsibilities depend on the services they select.

In general, the customer is always responsible for securing what's under their direct control, such as:

- Information and Data.
- User Access.
- Configuration of the cloud platform.
- The resources used to connect to the cloud.

In general, the cloud provider is always responsible for securing the physical hosts, network and data centers.
