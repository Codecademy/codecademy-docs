**Software as a service (SaaS)** is a cloud computing service delivery model that makes software and applications available over the Internet.

Some examples of SaaS include Google Workspace, Dropbox, and Microsoft 365.

## Architecture

SaaS services typically use a multi-tenant approach, where multiple consumers share access to cloud resources. Each tenant has their own space to store data. The data is isolated and will remain invisible to other tenants.

## Benefits

- Accessible: Requires only an internet connection, can be accessed from any internet-enabled device and location.
- Management: Users do not have to maintain anything; all maintenance and updates are provided by the service provider.
- Scalability: Users can access as many services as they want.

## Challenges

- Service Issues: Users may face issues that are beyond their control like security breaches, server outages, or service changes.
- Switching Providers: Depending on the amount of data being stored, it may be difficult to transfer the data to a different provider.
- Updates: If the service provider issues a new version of the product, the user may have to allocate time learning the newer version.
