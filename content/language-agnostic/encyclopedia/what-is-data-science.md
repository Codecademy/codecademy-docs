### Introduction
Data Science is a multidisciplinary field of study that utilizes data design, collection, and analysis to

*Wikipedia*:
Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.

Data science combines multiple fields, including statistics, scientific methods, and data analysis, to extract value from data.

The field encompasses preparing data for analysis, formulating data science problems, analyzing data, developing data-driven solutions, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in a broad range of application domains.

As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, statistics, information science, mathematics, information visualization, data integration, graphic design, complex systems, communication and business

*IBM*
Data science combines the scientific method, math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, AI, and even storytelling to uncover and explain the business insights buried in data.

Data science encompasses preparing data for analysis and processing, performing advanced data analysis, and presenting the results to reveal patterns and enable stakeholders to draw informed conclusions.

*Data Robot*
Data science is the field of study that combines domain expertise, programming skills, and knowledge of mathematics and statistics to extract meaningful insights from data.

Data science practitioners apply machine learning algorithms to numbers, text, images, video, audio, and more to produce artificial intelligence (AI) systems to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence. In turn, these systems generate insights which analysts and business users can translate into tangible business value.

### History

Many statisticians have argued that data science is not a new field, but rather another name for statistics. Considering this perspective, the history of data science would date

5th century B.C. — Athenians estimated the height of ladders necessary to scale the walls of Platea by having multiple
soldiers count the bricks, then multiplying the most frequent
count (the mode) by the height of a brick.

Al-Kindi (801-873 A.D.) wrote “Manuscript on Deciphering
Cryptographic Messages” which showed how to use frequency
analysis to decipher encrypted messages.

John Graunt in Natural and Political Observations Made Upon
the Bills of Mortality estimated the population of London in
1662 as 384,000 using records on the number of funerals per
year (13,000), the death rate (3 people per 11 families per
year), and average family size (8).


• German book Statistik, published in 1749, described the analysis of demographic and economic data about the state (political arithmetic in English)




In 1962, John W. Tukey wrote in “The Future of Data Analysis” - The first milestone in the history of data science is globally recognized for the bright American mathematician John Tukey. The influence of John Tukey in statistical terms is enormous, but the most famous coinage attributed to him is related to computer science. In fact, it should be mentioned that he was the first to introduce the term "bit" as a contraction of "binary digit."
In 1974, Peter Naur published the Concise Survey of Computer Methods, which surveyed data processing methods across a wide variety of applications. The term “data science” becomes clearer, as he puts his own definition on it: “The science of dealing with data, once they have been established, while the relation of the data to what they represent is delegated to other fields and sciences.”
In 1977, the International Association for Statistical Computing (IASC) was founded.
In 1989, Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro organized and chaired the first Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) workshop.
In 1994, BusinessWeek published a cover story on “Database Marketing.”
In 1996, on the occasion of the conference of the International Federation of Classification Societies (IFCS), for the first time, the term “data science” is included in the title of the conference (“Data science, classification, and related methods”). In the same year, Usama Fayyad, Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro, and Padhraic Smyth publish “From Data Mining to Knowledge Discovery in Databases.”
In 1997, during his inaugural lecture as the H. C. Carver Chair in Statistics at the University of Michigan, Jeff Wu called for statistics to be renamed “data science” and statisticians to be renamed “data scientists.”

Since the beginning of the 21st century, data stockpiles have expanded exponentially, largely thanks to advents in processing and storage that are both efficient and cost-effective at scale. The capability to collect, process, analyze, and display data and information in “real-time” give us an unprecedented opportunity to conduct a new form of knowledge discovery. To process this huge amount of data, Data Scientists need high performance also of a large portfolio of technologies to speed up tasks and data processing in a matter of seconds.

Disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning are nowadays available for Data Scientists thanks to powerful platforms available.



### Notable Techniques



Prediction (predict a value based on inputs)

Classification (e.g., spam or not spam)

Recommendations (e.g., Amazon and Netflix recommendations)

Pattern detection and grouping (e.g., classification without known classes)

Anomaly detection (e.g., fraud detection)

Recognition (image, text, audio, video, facial, …)

Actionable insights (via dashboards, reports, visualizations, …)

Automated processes and decision-making (e.g., credit card approval)

Scoring and ranking (e.g., FICO score)

Segmentation (e.g., demographic-based marketing)

Optimization (e.g., risk management)

Forecasts (e.g., sales and revenue)

For example, the well recognized Data Science Platform Saturn Cloud offers an end-to-end analytics platform all in Python on AWS. This includes:

Dask that allows organizations to scale out Python and dramatically reduce runtime.
Suite of collaboration tools, model deployment capabilities, and tools for the machine learning lifecycle.
Prefect that provides a workflow orchestration framework that eliminates manual effort on the part of developers and data scientists.
Integration with services like Docker and Kubernetes so that data scientists can build a custom image to meet their best development expectations.
Jupyter Notebooks to deploy, manage, and scale the PyData stack.

### Application
o extract valuable information from data for business decision-making, strategic planning and other uses. It's increasingly critical to businesses: The insights that data science generates help organizations increase operational efficiency, identify new business opportunities and improve marketing and sales programs, among other benefits. Ultimately, they can lead to competitive advantages over business rivals.

Data Science is used in generally every field of industry to find new efficiencies in business practices and products.
