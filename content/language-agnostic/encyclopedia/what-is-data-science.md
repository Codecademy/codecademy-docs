### Introduction
*Wikipedia*:
Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.

Data science combines multiple fields, including statistics, scientific methods, and data analysis, to extract value from data.

The field encompasses preparing data for analysis, formulating data science problems, analyzing data, developing data-driven solutions, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in a broad range of application domains.

As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, statistics, information science, mathematics, information visualization, data integration, graphic design, complex systems, communication and business

*IBM*
Data science combines the scientific method, math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, AI, and even storytelling to uncover and explain the business insights buried in data.

Data science encompasses preparing data for analysis and processing, performing advanced data analysis, and presenting the results to reveal patterns and enable stakeholders to draw informed conclusions.

*Data Robot*
Data science is the field of study that combines domain expertise, programming skills, and knowledge of mathematics and statistics to extract meaningful insights from data.

Data science practitioners apply machine learning algorithms to numbers, text, images, video, audio, and more to produce artificial intelligence (AI) systems to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence. In turn, these systems generate insights which analysts and business users can translate into tangible business value.

### History

data volumes have exploded.

### Notable Techniques



Prediction (predict a value based on inputs)

Classification (e.g., spam or not spam)

Recommendations (e.g., Amazon and Netflix recommendations)

Pattern detection and grouping (e.g., classification without known classes)

Anomaly detection (e.g., fraud detection)

Recognition (image, text, audio, video, facial, …)

Actionable insights (via dashboards, reports, visualizations, …)

Automated processes and decision-making (e.g., credit card approval)

Scoring and ranking (e.g., FICO score)

Segmentation (e.g., demographic-based marketing)

Optimization (e.g., risk management)

Forecasts (e.g., sales and revenue)
