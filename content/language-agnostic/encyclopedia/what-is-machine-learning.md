### Introduction
*Wikipedia*
Machine learning (ML) is a discipline of computer science that relates to the use of data and algorithms to development computer programs that improve their performance at tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine Learning is considered a branch of Artificial Intelligence as some machine learning algorithms are designed to imitate the way that humans learn and interact with their environment.

### Machine Learning Categories
Machine learning algorithms function are used several fields of business, most often with the goal of making a prediction, classification, or cluster from some input data:

 - Classification: classification, which separates the elements in a data set into different categories
 - Regression: regression, which plots the optimal values of related data variables in a line or plane
 - Clustering: which groups together data points with an affinity or shared attributes

### Machine Learning Categories
Machine learning algorithms can be grouped into four primary categories.

Supervised machine learning            
Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or underfitting. Supervised learning helps organizations solve for a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning include neural networks, naïve-bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and more.

Unsupervised machine learning
Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, image and pattern recognition. It’s also used to reduce the number of features in a model through the process of dimensionality reduction; principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common approaches for this. Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning include neural networks, k-means clustering, probabilistic clustering methods, and more.

Semi-supervised learning
Semi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and unsupervised learning. During training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of having not enough labeled data (or not being able to afford to label enough data) to train a supervised learning algorithm.

Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment. In reinforcement learning, an artificial intelligence faces a game-like situation. The computer employs trial and error to come up with a solution to the problem.

In the same way, reinforcement learning is a specialized application of machine and deep learning techniques, designed to solve problems in a particular way.

is a form of AI in which computers are given the ability to progressively improve the performance of a specific task with data, without being directly programmed *history* (this is Arthur Lee Samuel’s definition. He coined the term “machine learning”,
