Machine learning (ML) is a discipline of computer science that relates to the use of data and algorithms to development computer programs that improve their performance at tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine Learning is considered a branch of Artificial Intelligence as some machine learning algorithms are designed to imitate the way that humans learn and interact with their environment.

## Branches of Machine Learning
Machine learning can be categorized into three primary branches:

- Supervised learning: Machine Learning algorithms that receive labeled data as input and produce a prediction as output.
* Regression: Predict a continuous-valued output.
* Classification: Predicts a discrete number of values.

Some methods used in supervised learning include:

* Linear regression: Plots the optimal values of related data variables in a line or plane of "best fit".
* Logistic regression: Classifies elements in a data set into different categories.
* Na√Øve-Bayes classifier: Uses Bayes' theorem to perform classification of elements.
* Support vector machine (SVM): Margin classifiers that define hyperplanes to separate data points.   
* Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): Classifiers modeled after biological neural networks with relatively high performance capabilities.  

- Unsupervised Learning: Machine Learning algorithms that receive unlabeled data as input and produce a grouping or clustering as output.
* Clustering: Recognize patterns and structures in unlabeled data by grouping them into clusters.
* Dimensionality Reduction: Scale down the amount of dimensions in the dataset from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space, while maintaing the maximum amount of relevant information.

Some methods used in unsupervised learning include:

* K-Means: Categorizes data points into clusters based on their proximity to cluster centroids.
* Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering: Groups data points into clusters based on various measures of similarity such as smallest average distance between all points, minimal variance between data points, or smallest maximum distance between data points.  
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces the dimensionality of a dataset to the 'n' number of principal dimensions that contain the most valuable information.

- Reinforcement Learning (RL): Machine learning algorithms that receive a state, environment, reward, and goal as input and produce a policy of best action relative to the stated goal as output.
* Model-Free: Act as trial-and-error algorithms that use only real samples of the environment to calculate optimal actions instead of the transition probability distribution to create a model of the environment.
* Model-Based: Create a

Some methods used in reinforcement learning include:
* Markov Decision Processes (MDPs):
* Monte Carlo methods:
* Q-Learning/Deep Q-Learning: Model-Free algorithms that

### Evaluation
There are several methods to accurately evaluate the performance of ML algorithms. Methods vary based on which algorithm is being evaluated, and for which purpose. For classifiers such as Logistic Regression, confusion matrices inform analysts of the number of true and false positives as well as negatives to calculate values such as recall, precision, and F1 scores. These values help analysts understand if their models are underfitting or overfitting, which is critical to improving and maintaing their performance.
