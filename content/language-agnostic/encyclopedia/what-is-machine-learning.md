Machine learning (ML) is a discipline of computer science that relates to the use of data and algorithms to development computer programs that improve their performance at tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine Learning is considered a branch of Artificial Intelligence as some machine learning algorithms are designed to imitate the way that humans learn and interact with their environment.

## Branches of Machine Learning

- Supervised learning: Machine Learning algorithms that receive labeled data as input and make some prediction as output.
* Regression: Predict a continuous-valued output.
* Classification: Predicts a discrete number of values.

- Unsupervised Learning is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.
*Type of machine learning where the program learns the inherent structure of the data based on unlabeled examples.
Clustering: Finds patterns and structures in unlabeled data by grouping them into clusters

- Reinforcement Learning:


### Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning

### Evaluation

As input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately. This occurs as part of the cross-validation process to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or underfitting.

Supervised learning helps organizations solve for a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox.

Some methods used in supervised learning include:

* Linear regression: (straight) line of best fit: The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.

* Logistic regression: a classification algorithm. An interesting nuance is that it provides confidence values with its predictions since the raw output is a probability of a class between 0 and 1. The general process for this is similar to linear regression, where coefficients for various feature weights are altered in order to optimize the accuracy of subsequent predictions from the model.

* Naïve-Bayes classifier: "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naïve) independence assumptions between the features (see Bayes classifier). They are among the simplest Bayesian network models,[1] but coupled with kernel density estimation, they can achieve higher accuracy levels.

Naive Bayes algorithms extend Bayes' formula to multiple variables by assuming that these features are independent of one another. This then allows you to estimate an overall probability by multiplying the conditional probabilities for each of the independent features.

* Support vector machine (SVM): are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis.

Unsupervised machine learning
Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, image and pattern recognition. It’s also used to reduce the number of features in a model through the process of dimensionality reduction; principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common approaches for this. Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning include neural networks, k-means clustering, probabilistic clustering methods, and more.

Semi-supervised learning
Semi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and unsupervised learning. During training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of having not enough labeled data (or not being able to afford to label enough data) to train a supervised learning algorithm.

Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment. In reinforcement learning, an artificial intelligence faces a game-like situation. The computer employs trial and error to come up with a solution to the problem.

In the same way, reinforcement learning is a specialized application of machine and deep learning techniques, designed to solve problems in a particular way.
