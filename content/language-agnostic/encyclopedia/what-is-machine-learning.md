Machine learning (ML) is a discipline of computer science that relates to the use of data and algorithms to development computer programs that improve their performance at tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine Learning is considered a branch of Artificial Intelligence as some machine learning algorithms are designed to imitate the way that humans learn and interact with their environment.

## Branches of Machine Learning
Machine learning can be categorized into three primary branches:
- Supervised learning: Machine Learning algorithms that receive labeled data as input and produce a prediction as output.
* Regression: Predict a continuous-valued output.
* Classification: Predicts a discrete number of values.

Supervised learning is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.

As input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately. This occurs as part of the cross-validation process to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or underfitting.

Supervised learning helps organizations solve for a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox.

Some methods used in supervised learning include:

- Unsupervised Learning: Machine Learning algorithms that receive unlabeled data as input and produce a grouping or clustering as output.
* Clustering: Recognize patterns and structures in unlabeled data by grouping them into clusters.
* Dimensionality Reduction:

- Reinforcement Learning: Machine learning algorithms that receive a state, environment, and goal as input and produce a policy of best action relative to the stated goal as output.
* Markov Decision Processes (MDPs):
* Q-Learning/Dep Q-Learning:
