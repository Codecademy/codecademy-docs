# What is a Terminal?

A terminal is a program which allows programmers to type commands directly to the internal CPU or another network device. It is a no-frills program where a user simply inputs text, as opposed to a graphical user interface (GUI) where a user interacts with windows, buttons, and icons.

## Notable Examples

The terminal program has a different name according to the operating system you are using. With the MacOS, the command line is known as the *Terminal* while with Windows, it is known as *cmd*.
