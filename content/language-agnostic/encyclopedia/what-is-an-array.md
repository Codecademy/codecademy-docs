An an array is a list of ordered, stored data. They can hold items that are of any data type. 

## Syntax

Arrays are often created by using square brackets, with individual elements separated by commas.

```pseudo
array = [element0, element1, element2, element3]
```

## Index Number

You access an array element by referring to the index number.

A lot of times, array indexes start with 0:

```cpp
grocery = ["milk", "cookies", "berries", "carrots"]
// index:    0         1          2          3
```

- 0 is the first element. 
- 1 is the second element.
- 2 is the third element
- ...and so on.
