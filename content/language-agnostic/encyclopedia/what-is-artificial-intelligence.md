### Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is both a field of study of intelligent agents, and a reference to said intelligent agents themselves. These intelligent agents have the capacity to Currently, AI can be categorized into three groups, narrow, general, and super artificial intelligences.

### AI Categories
- Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI): ANI or Weak AI, are systems that are considered the least computationally potent AI. These systems include much of the contemporary machine learning and deep learning models with singular and narrowed functions such as Object Classification and Speech Recognition.

- Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): AGI or Strong AI, are systems that would pass the Turing Test, with an intelligence that produces outputs that are indistinguishable from that of an adult human being. As of publication, no publicly known AGI have been developed.

- Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI): ASI, or Superintelligence is another form of AI yet to be developed that contains an intelligence that can produce outputs that would vastly surpass the capacity of a human being.

### Ethics
The ethical implications of artificial intelligence have been explored in philosophy, industry, and culture. Current leaders in AI research with ethics in mind often follow charters that promote inclusion and safety for humanity.
