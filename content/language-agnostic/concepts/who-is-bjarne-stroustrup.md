Bjarne Stroustrup is the designer and original implementer of the computer programming language C++, an extension of the C programming language.

Stroustrup has authored several computer programming books focused on C++, including *The C++ Programming Language*, and is currently a Visiting Professor in Computer Science at Columbia University.

As principle designer of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup's goal for the language was "offering both hardware access and abstraction", and to do so efficiently. Stroustrup's continued work in maintaining C++ is associated with improvements in performance and efficiency for a great number of applications including AI/ML, RDBMS, video games, financial systems and graphics.
