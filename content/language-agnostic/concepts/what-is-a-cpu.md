CPU stands for Central Processing Unit and is an acronym used to describe the electrical circuity in a computer responsible for executing instruction sets derived from programs that have been converted into machine code. CPU's contain components called ALU's or Arithmetic Logic Units which perform operations, and then store the result to memory.  

CPU's sit at the heart of the system of a computer and are connected to the motherboard. They also have caches which act as  memory units capable of temporary storage and quick retrieval of files by the computer. The performance or speed of a processor depends on, among many other factors, the clock rate (usually measured in hertz) and the instructions per clock (IPC), which together are the factors that make up the instructions per second (IPS) which measures CPU performance. CPU's can have multiple cores which allow them to perform operations in parallel to one another which greatly increases the speed and efficiency of the computer.
