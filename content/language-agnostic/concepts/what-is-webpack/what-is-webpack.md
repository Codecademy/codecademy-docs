Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Webpack can be run on Linux, macOS, Windows operating systems.

As a module bundler, Webpack can be used with *webpack.config.js* to generate dependency graphs, and define rules for tasks performed on a site.

Node.js is required to use webpack.
