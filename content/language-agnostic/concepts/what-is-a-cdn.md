CDN stands for Content Delivery Network and is a method of implementing a cache in the browser which retains copies of web content at various points throughout a network and serves them to clients from the closest network location. 

CDN's are among recent innovations in technology which have improved the availability and speed with which we are able to access information on the internet because content that would normally have to travel long distances in order to be consumed by the client are now stored in local hubs geographically close in order to serve it to the user much faster.
