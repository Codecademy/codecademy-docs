Grace Hopper was a pioneering American computer scientist who led a decorated career in the United States Navy becoming one of the first female rear admirals.

One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer,
she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers.
Hopper was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages,
and the FLOW-MATIC programming language she created using this theory was later
extended to create COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.

Prior to joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University
and was a professor of mathematics at Vassar College. Hopper began her computing career in 1944
when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by Howard H. Aiken.

 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the director of the
 Navy Programming Languages Group in the
 Navy's Office of Information Systems Planning and was
 promoted to the rank of captain in 1973.

Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing this conference is designed to bring the research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront.

In 1949, she joined the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that developed
the UNIVAC I computer. At Eckert–Mauchly she managed the development of one of
the first COBOL compilers. She believed that a programming language based on English
was possible. Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by
computers. By 1952, Hopper had finished her program linker (originally called a compiler),
which was written for the A-0 System.[2][3][4][5] During her wartime service,
she co-authored three papers based on her work on the Harvard Mark 1.

In 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming,
and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC.
In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to
guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the
COBOL language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on English
words. In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967 the Navy recalled
her to active duty. She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant
for the Digital Equipment Corporation, sharing her computing experiences.

The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper was named
for her, as was the Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer at NERSC.[6] During her lifetime,
Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world.
A college at Yale University was renamed in her honor. In 1991, she received the
National Medal of Technology. On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded
the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.[7]
