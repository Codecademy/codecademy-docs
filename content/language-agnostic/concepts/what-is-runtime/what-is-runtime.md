In computer programming, runtime references the period of time during which a program is running, as well as the environment that communicates between the hardware and operating system.

Runtime code is specifically the code required to implement the features of the language itself.

The runtime environment specifically is any software or instructions that are executed while a program is running.

Runtime library is a special program library used by a compiler, to implement functions built into a programming language, during the runtime (execution) of a computer program. This often includes functions for input and output, or for memory management.

A run-time system (also called runtime system or just runtime) is software designed to support the execution of computer programs written in some computer language. The run-time system contains implementations of basic low-level commands and may also implement higher-level commands and may support type checking, debugging, and even code generation and optimization. Some services of the run-time system are accessible to the programmer through an application programming interface, but other services (such as task scheduling and resource management) may be inaccessible.
