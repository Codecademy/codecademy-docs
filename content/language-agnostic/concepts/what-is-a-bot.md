Bots are software applications which perform automated services. Bots perform tedious and repetitive tasks quicker and more efficiently than it would take humans. On the internet, servers use `robots.txt` files to state the rules for bot behavior on the server. It is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is made up of computer bots performing tasks on the web. Networks of zombie computers are called botnets.

## Some use cases for Bots include but are not limited to:

* To index web content. 
* Moderate or monitor forums for undesirable content. 
* To provide round the clock customer service support
* To simulate human speech patterns or entertain. Chat bots.


Malicious bots can be used to perform actions on servers which do not fulfill the intended desire of the users who maintain the server or attacked application. These bots are often used for denial of service attacks, spam and other nefarious.
