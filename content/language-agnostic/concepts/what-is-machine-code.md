Machine code (also known as machine language or native code) is a low level programming language in the form of hexadecimal or binary instructions that execute computer programs on the host computers CPU. 

In the early days of programming, applications were written directly in machine code, but as that method of developing applications is tedious and inefficient, programmers developed new higher level programming languages like C, Java and Python to be processed by compilers and turned into machine code for execution in the CPU. 

Every computer processor has its own instruction set; which are patterns of bits, digits or characters that correspond to machine code. These instruction sets make up a sort of class for the interpretation of machine code.
