The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol converts domain names to IP addresses. 

Think of it as a phonebook for the Internet. Itâ€™s hard to remember an exact IP address when we want to access a website. When we request the URL `codecademy.com`, our computer sends a DNS request to a DNS server. The server then returns the correct IP addresses to route data to and from Codecademy.
