The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol converts domain names to IP addresses. Think of it as a phonebook for the Internet. Itâ€™s hard to remember an exact IP address when we want to access a website. When we request the URL `codecademy.com`, our computer sends a DNS request to a DNS server. The server then returns the correct IP addresses to route data to and from Codecademy.

## Domain Name

Each domain name is made up of three parts:

`third-level-domain . second-level-domain . top-level-domain`

like

`shop.codecademy.com`

- Top level domain: There are a limited set of top level domains (TLDs), and many websites use the most common TLDs".com", ".org", and ".edu".
- Second level domain: The second level domain is unique to the company or organization that registers it, like "wikipedia" or "khanacademy".
- Third level domain (subdomain): It's owned by the same group and that URL often directs you to a subset of the website, like "m.wikipedia.org" (mobile-optimized Wikipedia) or "es.khanacademy.org" (Spanish-language Khan Academy).
