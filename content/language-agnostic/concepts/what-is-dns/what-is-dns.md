The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol converts domain names to IP addresses. Think of it as a phonebook for the Internet. Itâ€™s hard to remember an exact IP address when we want to access a website. When we request the URL `codecademy.com`, our computer sends a DNS request to a DNS server. The server then returns the correct IP addresses like `104.20.25.250` to route data to and from Codecademy.

## Domain Name

Each domain name is made up of three parts: 

`third-level-domain . second-level-domain . top-level-domain`

- Top level domain: There are a limited set of top level domains (TLDs), and many websites use the most common TLDs like ".com", ".org", and ".edu".
- Second level domain: The second level domain is unique to the company or organization that registers it, like "codecademy" or "wikipedia".
- Third level domain (subdomain): It's owned by the same group and that URL often directs you to a subset of the website.

Like [shop.codecademy.com](www.shop.codecademy.com) (Codecademy's merch shop) or [m.wikipedia.org](https://m.wikpedia.org) (mobile-optimized Wikipedia).
