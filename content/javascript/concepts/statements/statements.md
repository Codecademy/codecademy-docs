In JavaScript, statements are instructions that are executed by the browser or Node.js. A statement can be a simple or complex operation that performs an action, such as assigning a value to a variable, calling a function, or controlling program flow with conditional statements.

## Syntax

In this statement, a const variable called greeting is declared and assigned the value of 'Hello World':

```js
const greeting = 'Hello World';
```

The first statement assigns the value 5 to the variable x, while the second statement logs the value of x to the console:

```js
let x = 5;
console.log(x);
```
