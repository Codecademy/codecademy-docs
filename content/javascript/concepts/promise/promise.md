Title: 'Promise'
Description: 'A JavaScript Promise is an object that can be used to get the outcome of an asynchronous operation when that result is not instantly available. Since JavaScript code runs in a non-blocking manner, promises become essential when we have to wait for some asynchronous operation without holding back the execution of the rest of the code.'

A JavaScript `Promise` is an object that can be used to get the outcome of an asynchronous operation when that result is not instantly available.

Since JavaScript code runs in a non-blocking manner, promises become essential when we have to wait for some asynchronous operation without holding back the execution of the rest of the code.
