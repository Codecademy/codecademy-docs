# .length()

.length() is used on objects such as strings and arrays to return the length of the object.
The .length() function does vary when used on string vs arrays. 

## Syntax
length is called on a string through the following syntax and will output the number of characters of the string. 
```
const pet = dog;
console.log(pet.length);
///returns 3;
```
## Syntax 

length is called on an array through the following syntax.

```
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(array.length);

Remember arrays are 0 Indexed but .length will count the 0 as 1 in it's count.
