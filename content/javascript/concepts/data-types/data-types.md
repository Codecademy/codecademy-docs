Data types are the classifications we give to the different kinds of data that we use in programming. In JavaScript, there are seven fundamental data types:

| Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Number` | Any number, including numbers with decimals: `1`, `-2`, `99`, `3.14`. |
| `String` | Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes `''` or double quotes `""`. |
| `Boolean` | This data type only has two possible values — either `true` or `false`. |
| `Null` | This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword `null`. |
| `Undefined` | This data type is denoted by the keyword `undefined`. It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than `null`. |
| `Symbol` | A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now. |
| `Object` | Collections of related data. |

The first 6 of those types are considered primitive data types. They are the most basic data types in the language. Objects are a little more complex. 

At first, seven types may not seem like that many, but soon you’ll observe the world opens with possibilities once you start leveraging each one.
