A JavaScript object can be created or defined with an object literal:

```js
const person = {firstName: "Elizabeth", lastName: "Harmon", age: 22, eyeColor: "Hazel"};
```

Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines:

```js
const person = {
  firstName: "Elizabeth",
  lastName: "Harmon",
  age: 22,
  eyeColor: "Hazel"
};
```

## Object Properties

The `key: value` pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties:

| Property Key	| Property Value |
| --- | --- |
| `firstName` |	`"Elizabeth"` |
| `lastName` | `"Harmon"` |
| `age`  | `22` |
| `eyeColor` | `"Hazel"` |

## Accessing Object Properties

Object properties can be accessed using the dot notation:

```pseudo
objectName.propertyName
```

```js
person.lastName;
```

Or using square brackets:

```pseudo
objectName["propertyName"]
```

```js
person["lastName"];
```

## Object Methods

Object methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.

```js
const person = {
  firstName: "Elizabeth",
  lastName: "Harmon",
  age: 22,
  eyeColor: "Hazel",
  greeting: function() {
    return `Hi, I'm ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}.`;
  }
};

console.log(person.greeting());
```

- The `greeting` key holds a function value that returns a template literal using back-ticks(``).
- When `person.greeting` value is invoked, the corresponding function will run.

This will output:

```
Hi, I'm Elizabeth Harmon.
```
