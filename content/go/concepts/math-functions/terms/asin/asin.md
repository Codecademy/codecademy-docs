# Asin() Function

The **`Asin()`** function calculates the inverse sine (also known as arcsine) of a number.

## Syntax

```go
result := math.Asin(number)
```

### Parameters

- `number` (Type: `float64`): The input number for which you want to find the inverse sine. It must be within the range of `-1` and `1` (inclusive).


### Return Value

- Type: `float64`
- Description: The `Asin()` function returns the inverse sine value of `number` as a `float64`. This value represents an angle in radians whose sine equals the input `number`.

### Example

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	number := 0.5
	result := math.Asin(number)
	fmt.Printf("The inverse sine of %.2f is %.2f radians.\n", number, result)
}
```

In this example, we calculate the inverse sine of `0.5`, which results in an angle of approximately `0.52` radians.
```

I've improved the structure and added explanations to make it easier to understand. You can use this updated README file for your project.
