### C++ Overview

- C++ is a robust programming language highly suitable for performance-critical applications demanding speed and efficient memory management.
- It finds applications in diverse industries such as software and game development, robotics, microcontrollers, VR/AR, and scientific computing.

### Origin of C++

- [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/historical-technical-figures/bjarne-stroustrup) developed the C++ language at Bell Laboratories in 1979.
- C++ evolved from the [C](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/c) language, with the aim of incorporating [object-oriented programming](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/programming-paradigms/object-oriented-programming) features while retaining C's reputation for portability and low-level functionality.

### Versions of C++

- C++ has seen multiple versions, each defined by specifications created by the ISO C++ community.
Notable versions include:
- C++98 (ISO/IEC 14882:1998) - The first edition.
- C++03 (ISO/IEC 14882:2003) - The second edition.
- C++11 - The third edition.
- C++14 - The fourth edition.
- C++17 - The fifth edition.

### Differences Between Versions

- These versions exhibit variations primarily in terms of enhancements to the standard library and the expansion of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).
- Additionally, these standards may introduce changes in APIs, including deprecation of certain features.
- This concise summary provides a professional overview of C++ and its different versions, emphasizing their significance and key differences.

These versions have many differences, mainly additions to the standard library and expansion of APIs. These standards also have differences in APIs due to depreciation.
