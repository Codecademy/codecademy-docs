C++ is a very powerful programming language for performance-critical applications that rely on speed and efficient memory management. It’s used in a wide range of industries including software and game development, robotics, microcontrollers, VR/AR, and scientific computing; we can find C++ applications everywhere, from the bottom of the oceans to the surface of Mars.

It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup and his team at Bell Laboratories in 1979. As the name implies, C++ was derived from the C language; Bjarne’s goal was to add object-oriented programming into C, a language well-respected for its portability and low-level functionality.

Fun fact: Bjarne Stroustrup played a key role in the development of Codecademy's Learn C++ course.
