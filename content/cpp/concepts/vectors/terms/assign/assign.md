In C++, the **`.assign()`** method is used with [`vectors`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cpp/vectors) to replace existing elements or add new values. This method can either fill the vector with a specified number of copies of a value or replace the vector's contents with elements from a range, modifying its size if necessary.
