**Templates** refer to the ability to use a [type](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cpp/data-types) as a parameter in [functions](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cpp/functions) and [classes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cpp/classes). Such classes and methods are often referred to as using a generic type. This provides the ability to define a set of related classes or functions that can operate on many different types with a single declaration.

Templates are like [macros](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cpp/macros) in that they are expaned at compile-time. While the source only has one definition, the compiled code will have multiple copies of the template for each type actually used in calling it.
