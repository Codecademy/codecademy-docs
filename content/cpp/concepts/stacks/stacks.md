A **`stack`** is a container adaptor that stores elements in a last-in first-out (LIFO) order. Stacks are implemented as a container adaptor, a class that uses another container class as it's underlying container. The underlying container class can be a `vector`, `deque` or a `list`. If none is specified when creating a `stack` instance, the default `deque` is used.
