The .putifabsent() method in Dart is used to insert a key-value pair into a map if the key is not already present. If the key is already present, it does nothing and returns the existing value associated with the key.

## Syntax

```pseudo
V putIfAbsent(K key, V ifAbsent())
```

- `Key`: The key to check for or add in the map.
- `ifabsent`: A function that returns the value to be associated with the key if it is not already present in the map.

## Example

In this example, the key 'key3' is not present in the map, so the ifAbsent function () => 3 is invoked to provide the value 3. The key 'key1' and 'key2' are present so the ifAbsent function is not invoked and the existing values are returned.

```dart
void main() {
  var map = {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2};
// 'key3' is not present, so the value 3 will be provided by the ifabsent function
map.putifabsent('key3', () => 3); // {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2, 'key3': 3};

  // 'key1' is present, so the ifabsent function is not invoked
map.putifabsent('key1', () => 5); // Notice the output stays the same {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2, 'key3': 3};

print(map); // output {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2, 'key3': 3}
 
```

Here is the output for the above code:

```shell
{'key1': 1, 'key2': 2, 'key3': 3}
```
