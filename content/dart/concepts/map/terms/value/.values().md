## the definition of map **.values()** 
###### The values of a **map** class are iterated when being called by the property **.values()**. **value** is found within the **map** class. When called, matching values are returned in the form of a list. The length of the matching values may or may not be as long as the amount of key/value pairs in the searched map. The values of the data being iterated are compared in  ==  ; therefore it's not **strict-equals** comparison.
## Code example
###### e.g. 1: 
Iterable <V> **get** values;

###### e.g 2:
###### var fruits = {'apple': 1, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 3}; print (fruits.values); //(1,2,3)
