A **list** provides a way to organise and store a collection of items. Simply, lists act as containers which are able to hold different pieces of data, such as strings, integers, or even other lists. Lists are a great way to organise related data in an easy to manipulate format.
<!-- I think will be worth linking to other docs pages like 'strings' when this has been completed / submitted. -->

## Syntax

In Dart, you are able to create a list utilising the `List` class, which also uses square brackets (`[]`) and commas (`,`).

```dart
// Create a list of strings
List favouriteFruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange'];

// Create a list of integres
List oddNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```
