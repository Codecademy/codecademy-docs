The fmod() function in PHP is a built-in function used to calculate the remainder of two numbers (left dividend) divided by a specified divisor. 

Syntax
```pseudo
fmod(dividend, divisor)
```

Example
```php
$x = fmod(7,3);
echo $x; // Output: 1
```

Parameters
- dividend (numeric): The number from which the remainder is to be calculated
- divisor (numeric): The number to divide by

Usage
The fmod() function can be used to calculate the remainder of one number divided by another:
```php
$x = fmod(7,3);
echo $x; // Output: 1
```

Return Value
The fmod() function will return the remainder of the division of the dividend divided by the divisor.

Potential pitfalls
Since the fmod() function only accept numeric values as parameters, attempting to pass a non-numeric value can result in a warning being thrown. Additionally, attempting to pass a floating-point value as a parameter has the potential to return a fractional value.

Codebyte Example
```codebyte/php
require '/path/to/codebytes-sdk-php/autoload.php';

// Remainder of 7 divided by 3
echo Codebyte\codebyteEvaluate('fmod(7,3);');
// Output: 1
```
