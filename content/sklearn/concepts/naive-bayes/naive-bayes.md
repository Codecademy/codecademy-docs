**Naive Bayes** algorithms are supervised learning methods that calculate the probability of an outcome based on input data and prior knowledge, assuming all inputs are equal and independent of each other. These _naive_ assumptions are often violated in real-world scenarios. For example, a response to an email depends on someone else emailing first and a person is more likely to have freckles if his/her sister has freckles. Despite their simplicity, Naive Bayes algorithms often perform well in practice.

Typically, a preprocessed dataset is divided into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate the model’s accuracy. Scikit-learn provides several Naive Bayes classifiers, each suited for different types of supervised classification:

- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: Designed for occurrence counts (e.g., predicting book genre based on the frequency of each word in the text). The multinomial distribution requires discrete features represented as integers.
- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**: Designed for binary (yes/no) and boolean (true/false) features (e.g., predicting sales emails based on the presence of common sales phrases).
- **Categorical Naive Bayes**: Designed for features that can be separated into distinct categories (e.g., predicting a person’s favorite sport based on gender and preferred weather).
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Designed for continuous features. It assumes that features follow a Gaussian distribution curve and determines the most likely class for an instance by calculating the probability of each class.
- **Complement Naive Bayes**: Designed to address the limitations of the standard Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier when dealing with imbalanced datasets. Imbalanced datasets are those where some classes have significantly more examples than others.
