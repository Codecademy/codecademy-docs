**Nearest Neighbors Algorithms** are TODO

## Applications:
  - Classification
  - Regression
  - Anomaly Detection
  - Recommendation Systems

`Scikit-learn`'s nearest neighbors module, `sklearn.neighbors`, is versatile and can handle both high-dimensional data and large datasets efficiently using different algorithmic implementations.

## Codebyte Example (if applicable)

`Sklearn`, also known as as **Scikit-learn**, is a free, open-source machine learning library for Python. 

Usage of Nearest Neighbors in Scikit-learn
