In scikit-learn, the biclustering module provides various biclustering methods, such as Spectral Biclustering and Spectral Co-Clustering

## Example

Hereâ€™s the syntax for performing biclustering using the SpectralBiclustering algorithm:

```python

from sklearn.cluster import SpectralBiclustering

model = SpectralBiclustering(n_clusters=3)


model.fit(data_matrix)


row_labels = model.row_labels_
column_labels = model.column_labels_
```
