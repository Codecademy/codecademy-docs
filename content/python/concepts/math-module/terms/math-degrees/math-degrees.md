The **math.degrees()** function takes in an angle measured in radians and returns its degree equivalent.

## Syntax

```shell
math.degrees(x)
```

`math.degrees()` takes in a numeric value or expression `x`, which represents an angle measured in radians, and returns a floating point value representing the degree equivalent to `x`.

_Some common degree-radian equivalencies._

## Example

Use `math.degrees()` to return the degree equivalent to `Ï€`:

```py
import math

pi = math.pi
print(math.degrees(pi))
```

The above code gives the following output:

```shell
180.0
```

Use `math.degrees()` to return the degree equivalent to 1 radian:

```py
import math

print(math.degrees(1.0))
```

The above code gives the following output:

```shell
57.29577951308232
```

## Codebyte Example

Run the following example using the `math.degrees()` function to understand its working:

```codebyte/python
import math

radian_angle = math.pi / 2
print(math.degrees(radian_angle))
```
