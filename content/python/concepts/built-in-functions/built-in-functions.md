**Built-in functions** in Python are a set of pre-defined functions that are readily available to use without the need to import any external libraries. These functions provide essential functionality for performing common tasks, such as manipulating data types, handling input/output, and more. Python includes 68 built-in functions, which are categorized and listed alphabetically for easy reference.

## Example

The below build-in function `len()` in Python returns the length of an object.

```python
# Example of len() in a list
states = ["Idaho", "Kansas", "Louisiana"]

# Example of len() in a string
text = "Hello, World!"

print(len(states))
print(len(text))
```

The output of the above code:

```shell
3
13
```
