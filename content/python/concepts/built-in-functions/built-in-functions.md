The Python interpreter has a set of functions and types built into it (pre-defined). They are always available for the Python programmer without needing to import them.

For example, to use the `abs()` built-in function, also known as the "absolute function", simply use it in any Python program:

```py
print(abs(-6.5))
```

All the Python built-in functions are listed here in alphabetical order.
