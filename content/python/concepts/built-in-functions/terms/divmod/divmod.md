Returns the quotient and remainder of the division of two numbers.

## Syntax

```py
divmod(x, y)
```

## Example 1

Use `divmod()` to calculate the quotient and remainder of dividing `10` by `3`:

```codebyte/python
result = divmod(10, 3)

print(result)  # Output: (3, 1)
```

In this example, the quotient of 10 divided by 3 is 3, and the remainder is 1.


## Example 2

Use `divmod()` to calculate the quotient and remainder of dividing `-15` by `4`:

```codebyte/python
result = divmod(-15, 4)

print(result)  # Output: (-4, 1)
```

In this example, the quotient of -15 divided by 4 is -4, and the remainder is 1.

## Example 3

Use `divmod()` to calculate the quotient and remainder of dividing `7.5` by `2.2`:

```codebyte/python
result = divmod(7.5, 2.2)

print(result)  # Output: (3.0, 0.9)
```

In this example, the quotient of 7.5 divided by 2.2 is 3.0, and the remainder is 0.9.
