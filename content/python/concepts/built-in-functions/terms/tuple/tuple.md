The built-in **`tuple()`** function creates a new [tuple](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/tuples).

## Syntax

```pseudo
tuple(iterable)
```

The `iterable` parameter is optional and is an object that can be looped over, such as a [list](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/lists) or [string](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/strings).

## Codebyte Example

The following example showcases how the `tuple()` function is used to create a new tuple:

```codebyte/python
my_tuple = tuple(1, 2, 3)

print(my_tuple)
```
