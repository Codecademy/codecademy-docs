The `input()` built-in function takes in a value from the user and converts the value into a string.

This function is unique in that the environment creates a field to allow users to enter the value.

## Syntax

```py
input()
```

## Example 1

Use `input()` to prompt user to input a value:

```python
password = input()

print(password)
```

## Example 2

Use `input()` to prompt user to input a value based on a message:

```python
username = input("What is your name?")

print(username)
```
