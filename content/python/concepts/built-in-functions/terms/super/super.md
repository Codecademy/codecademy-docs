The **`super()`** function returns a temporary object that allows a given [class](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/classes) to [inherit](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/inheritance) the methods and properties of a parent or sibling class.

## Syntax

```pseudo
super().method()
super(type, obj)
```

`.method()` is the accessed method of the parent class. `type` specifies the type object of the parent class and object is an instance or subtype of the `type`.

## `super()`

`super()` returns a temporary object of the superclass, allowing the superclassâ€™s methods to be called. This comes in handy when using multiple inheritance to derive a class from more than one base class.

## Codebyte Example

In this case, the `.say_hi()` method is implemented utilizing `super()` inside `.intro()`:

```codebyte/python
# Base class
class ProgramLanguage:
  def say_hi(self):
    print("Hi! I am a Programming Language")

# Derived class
class Python(ProgramLanguage):
  def intro(self):
    super().say_hi()
    print("Python here!")

doc = Python()
doc.intro()
```

In this case, the `.say_hi()` method is implemented utilizing `super(type, object)` inside `.intro()`:

```codebyte/python
# Base class
class ProgramLanguage:
  def say_hi(self):
    print("Hi! I am a Programming Language")

# Derived class
class Python(ProgramLanguage):
  def intro(self):
    super(Python, self).say_hi()
    print("Python here!")

doc = Python()
doc.intro()

```
