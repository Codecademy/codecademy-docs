The `print()` function accepts an object as a parameter, such as a string, a number, or a list. It is then converted to a string through an implicit call of the built-in `str()` function and the value is printed to an output stream.

## Syntax

```py
print(object)
```

## Example

```py
print("Hello, World")
```

The output would be:

```pseudo
Hello, World!
```

**Note:** To print an integer of a floating-point number, use the str() function.
