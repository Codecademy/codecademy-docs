The `print()` function takes in a string or any other element such as an integer converted to a string using `str()` and displays those values to the standard output device.

## Syntax

```py
print(object)
```

The output would be:

```pseudo
Hello, World!
```

If one were to print an integer of a floating-point number they can do so by using the str() function.
