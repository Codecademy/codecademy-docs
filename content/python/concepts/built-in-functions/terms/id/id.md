The id() Function
The id() function is a built-in function in Python that returns the identity of an object. It returns a unique integer identifier for each object, which remains constant during its lifetime. This identifier can be used to determine if two objects are the same or different.

Syntax
The syntax for using the id() function is as follows:

id(object)

object (required): The object for which you want to obtain the identifier.
Return Value
The id() function returns an integer that represents the unique identifier of the object passed as an argument.

Example Usage
Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of the id() function:

x = 10
y = x
z = 10

print(id(x))  # Output: 140710291386928
print(id(y))  # Output: 140710291386928
print(id(z))  # Output: 140710291386928

# The identifiers for x, y, and z are the same since they refer to the same object in memory.

In this example, x, y, and z all have the same value, but they are not separate objects. The id() function reveals that they have the same identifier, indicating that they refer to the same object in memory.

Notes
The identifier returned by id() is unique for each object, but it is not guaranteed to be unique across different program runs or different instances of Python.

The id() function can be useful for debugging, comparing objects, and tracking object references.
