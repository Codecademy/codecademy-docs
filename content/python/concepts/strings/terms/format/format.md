Python's built-in string function `.format()` converts strings by inserting values passed through placeholders.

`{}` is a placeholder. All the arguments specified in the format method will be replacing the placeholders in the string.

## Syntax

```py
string.format(obj1, obj2, ...)
```

## Example 1

Using empty placeholders `{}`.

```py
string1 = "I like to eat {} and {}"

new_string = string1.format("apple", "orange")

print(new_string)
# Output: I like to eat apple and orange
```

Values are inserted in the order they appear in `.format()` when using multiple empty placeholders.

## Example 2

Using numbered placeholders `{0,1,2,...}`.

```py
string1 = "I like to eat {0} and {1}"
new_string1 = string1.format("apple", "orange")

string2 = "I like to eat {1} and {0}"
new_string2 = string2.format("apple", "orange")

print(new_string1) # Output: I like to eat apple and orange
print(new_string2) # Output: I like to eat orange and apple
```

Each value in `.format()` is assigned with an index starting from `0`. When the index is called in the placeholder, the corresponding value will be entered in.

## Example 3

Using keyword placeholders `{food1, food2, ...}`.

```py
string1 = "I like to eat {food1} and {food2}"
new_string1 = string1.format(food1="apple", food2="orange")

string2 = "I like to eat {food2} and {food1}"
new_string2 = string2.format(food1="apple", food2="orange")

print(new_string1) # Output: I like to eat apple and orange
print(new_string2) # Output: I like to eat orange and apple
```

Similar to example 2, values in `.format()` can be used with keyword arguments. When the keyword is claled in the placeholder, the corresponding value will be entered in.

## Example 4

Combining both numbered and keyword placeholders `{0, food1, ...}`

```codebyte/python
string1 = "I like to eat {food1} and {0}"
new_string1 = string1.format("orange", food1="apple")

string2 = "I like to eat {0} and {food1}"
new_string2 = string2.format("orange", food1="apple")

print(new_string1)
print(new_string2)
```

By combining index from example 2 and keyword from example 3, both can be used in a single `.format()` statement.
