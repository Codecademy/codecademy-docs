`pip` is the package installer used in Python to install code packages. If you're familiar with Node Package Manager (npm) in JavaScript, then `pip` is the same community driven package space, but for Python.

## Packages

The concept of packages is not unique to `pip`. A package is essentially a collection of code that is designed for a specific purpose. One example is the [neuralart](https://pypi.org/project/neuralart/) project, which is a project on PyPi that is used for "rendering generative art from a randomly initialized neural network." It's a very cool package that creates art from your computer.
