PyTorch is an [open source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/open-source) Python module that offers an optimized tensor library for deep learning. It is based on the Torch library and can be used for applications such as natural language processing and computer vision. Developed primarily by Meta (Formerly Facebook) AI and released in 2016, it is free and open source software. Deep learning software built on PyTorch include Tesla Autopilot and Uber's Pyro.

## Features

PyTorch offers two high-level features:

- Tensor computing that can take advantage of acceleration via GPUs.
- Deep neural networks.

## Installation

Instructions for installing on various systems can be found on [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

> **Note:** The [`numpy`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/numpy) module is a prerequisite for a PyTorch install.
