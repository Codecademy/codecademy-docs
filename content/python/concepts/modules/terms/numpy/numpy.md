**NumPy** is a popular [open source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/open-source) Python library used for complex mathematical operations and multi-dimensional arrays. It is a basic library used for most scientific applications. To use NumPyâ€™s objects and methods, it will need to be installed first. There are instructions on how to do so on the [NumPy website](https://numpy.org/install/).

More details on NumPy is available on the Docs' [Python:NumPy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/numpy) page.
