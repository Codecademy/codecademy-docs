The **`tqdm`** module is a library that allows the generation of progress bars in Python. The name is derived from the Arabic _"taqaddum"_, which translates as "progress." It is designed to have minimal overhead, using algorithms to predict remaining time and to skip unnecessary iteration displays. It has about a 60ns overhead per iteration whereas other progress bar implementations can run a 800ns overhead per iteration. `tqdm` does not require any dependencies.
