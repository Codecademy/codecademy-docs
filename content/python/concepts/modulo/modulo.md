In Python, the percent sign (`%`) is known as the modulo operator. A modulo calculation returns the remainder of a division between the first and second number.

## Example 1

```py
# Define a variable with a modulo operator
x = 12 % 5

print(x) # Output: 2
```

Because 12 is not evenly divisible by 5, the outcome of `12 % 5` would be 2, leaving a remainder of 2.

## Codebyte Example

```codebyte/py
x = 12 % 5

print(x)
```
