In Python, the percent sign (`%`) is known as the modulo operator. A modulo calculation returns the remainder of the division between two numbers.

## Example 1

```py
x = 12 % 5

print(x) # Output: 2
```

Because 12 is not evenly divisible by 5,  the value of x is 2.

## Codebyte Example

```codebyte/py
num = 3

if (num % 2) == 0:
  print("Even")
else:
  print("Odd")

print(x)
```
