A `DataFrame` is the primary object used by the Pandas module to store and manipulate data. It is a structured collection of data arranged in rows and columns, similar to a database table.

Many Pandas functions, such as [`.read_csv()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/pandas-module/read-csv) return `DataFrame` objects. Other functions take `DataFrame` objects and accept them as parameters. In addition, most of Pandas' functionality is implemented through the `DataFrame` object. Methods and properties of the `DataFrame` object will be listed under the [Pandas module entry](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/pandas-module).
