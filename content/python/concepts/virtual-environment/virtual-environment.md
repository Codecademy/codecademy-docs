A **virtual environment** in Python is a self-contained directory that contains its own Python interpreter and installed packages. It allows developers to manage dependencies for different projects independently, avoiding version conflicts between libraries and ensuring that the project has the specific dependencies it requires.

## Why Use a Virtual Environment?

- **Avoid Dependency Conflicts**: Different projects may require different versions of the same package. A virtual environment isolates dependencies for each project.
- **Clean Environment**: It prevents polluting the global Python environment with unnecessary or conflicting packages.
- **Reproducibility**: It ensures that the exact environment can be replicated by others, improving collaboration and deployment consistency.

## Creating a Virtual Environment

The syntax for creating a virtual environment is as follows:

```pseudo
python -m venv <name_of_virtual_environment>
```

- `name_of_virtual_environment`: The name of the directory to store the virtual environment.

For example, if you want to create a virtual environment named `myenv`, the command will look like this:

```shell
python -m venv myenv
```

This creates a virtual environment named `myenv` in the current directory.

## Activating a Virtual Environment

To activate a virtual environment on Windows, following command is used:

```shell
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

To activate a virtual environment on macOS/Linux, following command is used:

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

Once the virtual environment is activated, we can proceed to install packages and run Python scripts within the isolated environment.

## Deactivating a Virtual Environment

To deactivate a virtual environment, we can run the following command:

```shell
deactivate
```

This deactivates the current virtual environment, returning to the global Python environment.
