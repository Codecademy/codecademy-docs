Operators are used to perform various operations on variables and values. The standard arithmetic and assignment operators are the most familiar.

## Syntax

The following code snippet uses an arithmetic operator for multiplication, `*`, to calculate the product of two numbers, along with the assignment operator, `=`, to store the result in the variable `x`.

```py
# Store five times three in variable x
x = 5 * 3
```

Python operators can be organized into the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators

## Arithmetic Operators

Python has the following arithmetic operators:

- `+`: Addition, returns the sum of two numbers.
- `-`: Subtraction, returns the difference of two numbers.
- `*`: Multiplication, returns the product of two numbers.
- `/`: Division, returns the quotient of two numbers.
- `**`: Exponentiation, returns the value of one number raised to the power of another.
- `%`: Modulus, returns the remainder of one number divided by another.
- `//`: Floor division, returns integer quotient of two numbers.

## Assignment Operators

Python includes the following assignment operators:

- `=`: Assigns the value on the left to the variable on the right.
- `+=`: Adds the value on the right to the variable on the left then assigns the result to the variable on the left.
- `-=`: Subtracts the value on the right from the variable on the left then assigns the result to the variable on the left.
- `*=`: Multiplies the value on the right with the variable on the left then assigns the result to the variable on the left.
- `/=`: Divides the value on the right into the variable on the left then assigns the result to the variable on the left.
- `%=`: Calculates the modulus of the variable on the right with the value on the left and assigns the result to the variable on the left.

## Comparison Operators

Python has the following comparison operators:

- `==`: Equal, `True` if two values are equal.
- `!=`: Not equal, `True` if two values are not equal.
- `<`: Less than, `True` if left value less than right value.
- `<=`: Less than or equal to, `True` if left value is less than or equal to right value.
- `>`: Greater than, `True` if left value greater than right value.
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to, `True` if left value greater than or equal to right value.

## Logical Operators

Python has the following logical operators:

- `and` : Returns `True` if both statements are `True`.
- `or` : Returns `True` if either statement is `True`.
- `not` : Returns `True` if following statement is `False`.
