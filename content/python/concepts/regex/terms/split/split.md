## Definition

Divide a string into substrings at each occurrence of the specified character(s). This method is a good alternative to the default python `.split()` for instances that require matching multiple characters.

## Syntax

```py
re.split(<pattern>, string, <maxsplit>, <flags>)
```

A `<pattern>` can include any of the following:

- A string: `Jane Smith` 
- A character class code: `/w`, `/s` , `/d`
- A regex symbol: `$`,  `|`,  `^` 

The other arguments include:

- An integer for the maximum number of splits (max split): `4` 
- Flags: `IGNORECASE`,  `VERBOSE`,  `DOTALL`

## Example

Split the text at each parenthesis:

```py
import re

race_info = '''The top three race finishers were: Jane Smith (2:14), Sarah Long (2:18) and Suzy Reynolds (2:20).'''

re.split(r'\(|\)', race_info)
# A backslash indicates that the parentheses are part of the pattern 
```
