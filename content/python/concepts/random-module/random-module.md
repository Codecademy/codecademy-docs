The [`random` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) is built into Python and used for working with numbers randomly generated from collections such as [lists](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/lists) and [strings](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/strings).

This module can be used when imported at the top of a Python file:

```py
import random
```

The `random` variable can then be used for executing its supplied functions.

```py
random.random()
```
