Casting (also known as type conversion) is a process that converts a variable's data type into another data type. These conversions can be implicit (automatically interpreted) or explicit (using built-in functions).

## Implicit Type Conversion

Python's interpreter automatically type casts one data type into another data type. This type of conversion is done without any user involvement.

In order to avoid data loss, Python converts smaller data types to higher data types. In the below example, the integer `7` is type casted to a float when added with `2.2`. Since the expression represents the sum of two `float` values, the data type of `y` is also `float`.

```py
y = 7 + 2.2 # Python automatically type casts y into float

print(y)
print(type(y))
```

This will output:

```shell
9.2
<class 'float'>
```

## Explicit Type Conversion

In explicit type casting, the user converts the data type of a variable using a predefined function. This function is typically the constructor of another data type.

- `str()`: This function takes an integer or float as an argument and converts it to a string.
- `int()`: This function takes string or float as an argument converts it to an integer.
- `float()`: This function takes integer or string as an argument and converts it to a float.

### Type Casting `int` to `str`

In example below, the integer `x` is casted to a string using the `str()` function.

```py
x = 7

# Casting into string
y = str(x)

print(x)
print(y)

print(type(x)) # Printing the data type of x
print(type(y)) # Printing the data type of y
```

This will output:

```shell
7
7
<class 'int'>
<class 'str'>
```

### Type Casting `str` to `int`

The below example does the opposite â€” the string variable `x` is casted to an integer using the `int()` function.

```py
x = "7"

# Casting into integer
y = int(x)

print(x)
print(y)

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
```

This will output:

```shell
7
7
<class 'str'>
<class 'int'>
```

Note that `x` must be the string representation of an integer for casting to work. In the above example, `x` is a string that contains a number. So there's no error during type casting.

If `x` is a string of characters or letters, it will raise `valueError` during type casting:

```py
x = 'seven'
y = int(x)
```

This will output:

```error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 3, in <module>
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'seven'
```

## Operations on Different Types of Data

When operating on data, it is important to keep their type in mind. The following Codebyte is a flawed attempt to print the square of a number specified by the user. Try running it and ponder the result.

```codebyte/py
num = input("Please enter a number: ")
print(num ** 2)
```

What happened? The `input()` function takes input from the user and stores it in a variable as a string. However, the `**` operator takes two numbers and returns the first number to the power of the second. In order to make the code work, the input variable must be cast to a number type. Try to edit the above Codebyte to successfully square a number inputted by the user.
