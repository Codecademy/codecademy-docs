## User Inputs

In [python](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python), **user input** refers to input prompts requesting entry from users during code or program executions. 

Python makes room for this to happen by pausing the running program when a user is required to input data. When the user clicks enter, the running program continues on the condition of the inputed data.User input encourages flexibility, usability and personalization of set workflow. Cases in whuch these are used include webpages, desktop and console applications, 

This is achieved by using the input() function in Python 3.6 and raw_input() in Python 2.7 previously. 

The following consist of an input() function. 

```py
name = input("What is your name?:")
print("Hello " + name + "!, This is Codecademy.")

```
