## Definition
The built-in `abs()` function takes in a numeric data type such as `int` or `float` and returns the absolute value of the argument.

## Example 1
```codebyte/python
print(abs(-6.5))
```

## Example 2
```codebyte/python
numbers = [-19.2, 27.3, 48, -115, 302.7, -421, -2011]

print([abs(number) for number in numbers])
```
