## Definition
The built-in `input()` takes in a value from the user and converts the value into a string. This function is unique in that the environment creates a field to allow users to enter the value.

## Example 1
```codebyte/python
user_enters = input()

print(user_enters)
```

## Example 2
```codebyte/python
user_enters_name = input("What is your name?")

print(user_enters)
```
