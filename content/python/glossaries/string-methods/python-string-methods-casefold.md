```

## Example 1

Use `casefold()` to set all characters in a string to lower case:
```codebyte/python
print("THIS SHOULD ALL BE IN LOWERCASE!".casefold())
```

## Example 2
***
Use `casefold()` to set all characters in a string to lower case:
```codebyte/python
text = "this Should All Be In Lower Case!"

x = text.casefold()
print(x)
```
