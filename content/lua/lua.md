## Historical Overview of the Language

Lua is a multi-paradigm language, supporting various programming styles, that was created to extend software applications. Inspired by SOL (Simple Object Language) and DEL (Data-Entry Language), Lua has grown into a language used in many unexpected ways. Brazilian Professors Roberto Lerusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes created Lua in 1993 because they were unable to get computer software abroad with Brazil's strong trade barriers

## Advantages of Lua

### Minimalistic and Easy to Grasp

Lua is designed to be easy to grasp as it only contains _21 keyterms_ and has a short learning curve compared to other languages. Lua's simplicity may also be deemed beneficial. While it is unlikely that we will create the next innovation in graphics with Lua, the language is less stimulating and thus allows for better focus when programming.

### Performant and Customizable

Lua is often thought to beat Python in terms of performance. It’s high performance output plays a role in it’s popularity. Lua’s automatic **garbage collection** allows developers to create and forget about garbage collection. Additionally, Lua provides us with the ability to control how we want garbage to be collected.

### Powerful for Developers

Lua can leave many things left to be desired by developers. With the control provided by the language developers can create useful programming frameworks, tools, and other resources that they deem fit.

## Common Uses of Lua

### Game development 
- Due to its simple syntax, Lua is often used for game development, though it does tend to lack in graphics and advanced operations. Some popular games that use Lua or a modified version of it are ROBLOX, Garry’s Mod, and Civilizations V.  

- Lua is especially useful for game development because it can be used as an “extension language”, meaning that it can be embedded in most other platforms or systems. 

### Software Applications using Lua
- Adobe Photoshop Lightroom's user interface is built with Lua.
- Celestia, an astronomy educational program, was developed in Lua.
- MySQL Workbench's extensions and add-ons are created in Lua.
- WeeChat IRC client allows scripts to be written in Lua.

### Extensions/Compatibility
- Lua can be used in any platform that supports C, C#, C++, and Java programming languages.
- Lua's usability is enhanced by being used in any scripting languages.
