The **Mathematical Library** holds Lua built-in functions that relate to math. Just as `print()` is a built-in function, Lua offers other functions for specific use cases.

## Math Functions
Lua’s Mathematical Library contains various math functionalities, but here are a few most commonly used functions:

#### `math.max(x, ..)`
Returns the max value from arguments.

#### `math.min(x, ..)` 
Returns the min value from arguments.

#### `math.pow(x, y)`
Returns x to the y power (x^y).

#### `math.random(a, ...)`
Returns a random integer between 0 and 1 when no arguments are given, a random integer from 1 to a when one argument is given, or a random integer betwen a and b when two arguments are given.

#### `math.sqrt(x)`
Returns square root of x (√x).

To see a full list of math functions, visit [the Lua documentation page](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5.6).
