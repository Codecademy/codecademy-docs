Lua **`math.deg()`** is a function that converts an angle in radians to degrees.It takes in one argument, i.e the angle in radians.

## Syntax

```lua

math.deg(x)

```

## Example

```lua

local radians =  math.pi  /  3  -- i.e (Ï€/3)

--math.pi is used to get the value of PI.

local degrees =  math.deg(radians)

print("The angle in degrees :",degrees)

```

The code will return the following output:

```shell

The  angle  in  degrees  :  60.0

```
