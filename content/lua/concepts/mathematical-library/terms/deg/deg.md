The Lua  built-in function **`math.deg()`** converts an angle in radians to degrees. It takes in one argument, the angle in radians to be converted.

## Syntax

```pseudo
math.deg(x)
```

Here x is the angle in randians, that has to be converted to degrees.

## Example

Consider the following code:

```lua

local radians =  math.pi  /  3  -- i.e (Ï€/3)

--math.pi is used to get the value of PI.

local degrees =  math.deg(radians)

print("The angle in degrees :",degrees)

```

The code will return the following output:

```shell

The  angle  in  degrees  :  60.0

```
