Lua **`table.clear()`** is a function that removes all the elements from a table, leaving it empty. It is equivalent to iterating over the table and setting each key to nil.

## Syntax

```lua
table.clear(t)
```

The `.clear()` function makes the specified table `t` empty, meaning the table does not contain any elements anymore.

## Example

Consider the following table:

```lua
local list{"üçé","üçì","üçâ"}

table.clear(list)

print("Elements:" #list)
```

The code will return the following output:

```shell
Elements: 0
```

First we intiate a table 'list'. Then we use the `.clear()` function to remove all elements of the table.Now if we try to print the number of elements it will simply print `0` as there are no elements in the table.
