In Lua, to convert a decimal value to its internal character value we make use of the **string.char()** function.

## Syntax
```codebyte/js
string.char(I)
```
In the above syntax, the identifier I represents the decimal value which we want to convert into a character.

## Example

1. Letâ€™s consider a very simple example, where you are given different decimal values, and you want to convert them to a character value.

**Input**

```codebyte/js
s = string.char(97)
print(s)
s = string.char(122)
print(s)
s = string.char(125)
print(s)
```

**Output**

```codebyte/js
a
z
}
```

2. The string.char() function can take multiple arguments as well.

**Input**

```codebyte/js
i = 97
s = string.char(i,i+1,i+2,i+3)
print(s)
```

**Output**

```codebyte/js
abcd
```
