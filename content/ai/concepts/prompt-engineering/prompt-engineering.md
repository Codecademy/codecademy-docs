**Prompt Enginneering** is a low-code solution to providing instructions to Artifical Intelligences(AIs). AIs are typically trained with large amounts of data. As a result, when an AI is given a task, it uses all this data to complete the task. Keep in mind, the task probably does not require that much data. This introduces a handful of issues. Such as hallucinations, or possibly using data that is irrelevant to completing the task. Prompt Engineering allows users to clearly define the guard rails in which the AI must follow in completing the task assigned to it.
