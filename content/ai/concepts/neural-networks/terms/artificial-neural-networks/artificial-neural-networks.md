**Artificial neural networks (ANN)** are a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. 
## What Is An Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

- It is a type of machine learning process, called deep learning, that uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles the human brain.
- An ANN is one of the main tools used for machine learning, it is a brain-inspired system used to replicate the way that humans learn.

### The Process

- Neural Networks are trained on specific data which then get broken down into the input layer ( where information is fed into) then to the hidden layer (where weight & bias are calculated from the input layer) & lastly the output layer ( where information is output after algorithms are processed from the hidden & input layers) via perceptrons (similar to human neurons but for machines to process, store, calculate & move data forward)

## Relation To AI

### Part 1

- AI works on a collections of technologies which allow the computer to sense, learn, reason & act, it powers algorithms which are instructions encoded in computer programs.
- AI works because of machine learning which is equipped with algorithms & vast amounts of datasets trained to recognize patterns & solve complex problems.

### Part 2

- Neural Networks are the core for ML algorithms, Neural Networks are trained on specific datasets which it extracts the information from & passes it through different layers searching for patterns.
- Once Neural Networks are trained on a dataset it can start to encounter new scenarios & start making predictions based off that previous dataset.
