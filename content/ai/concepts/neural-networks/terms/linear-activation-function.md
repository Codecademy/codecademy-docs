**Linear functions** are fundamental mathematical models that play a crucial role in machine learning and artificial intelligence. They provide a simple yet powerful way of describing the relationships between variables.

For example, here's an image illustrating a linear function with data points plotted on a graph:

This entry explores linear functions and their applications in AI.

## Representation

A linear function can be represented by the equation `y = mx + b`, where:
- `y` is the dependent variable or output.
- `x` is the independent variable or input.
- `m` is the slope of the line, which determines the rate of change.
- `b` is the y-intercept, representing the value of `y` when `x` is zero.

## Slope

The slope (`m`) is a critical parameter in linear functions. In the context of AI, the slope represents the weight or coefficient associated with the input variable (`x`). It determines the impact of `x` on the output `y`. The larger the slope, the larger the impact of `x` on the prediction.

During the training process, AI algorithms adjust the slope (weight) to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. This optimization procedure is known as gradient descent, where the gradient of the loss function guides the update of the slope to improve the model's performance.

## Y-Intercept

The y-intercept (`b`) is another essential parameter in linear functions. In AI, the y-intercept often corresponds to the bias term of the model. The bias term allows the model to make predictions even when the input is zero.

Similar to the slope, the y-intercept is also adjusted during the training phase to optimize the model's performance. The AI algorithm learns the optimal bias term that helps shift the linear function to fit the data accurately.

## Graphical Representation

While AI algorithms work with numerical calculations, visualizing linear functions can provide valuable insights. Graphs help us understand the behavior of the model and its relationship with the data.

To graph a linear function, follow these steps:
1. Plot the data points from your dataset, where the x-axis represents the input variable (`x`) and the y-axis represents the output variable (`y`).
2. Choose the initial slope (`m`) and y-intercept (`b`) values or use the randomly initialized values of training a model.
3. Calculate the predicted output for each input using the linear function equation `y = mx + b`.
4. Plot the predicted values on the graph.
5. Connect the points to visualize the line representing the linear function.

## Example

Let's consider a simple model that predicts housing prices based on the size of the house (`x`). The model is represented by the linear function `y = 100x + 50`, where `y` is the predicted price.

To graph this function, plot the actual housing price data points on the graph, initialize the slope as 100, and the y-intercept as 50. Calculate the predicted prices for the corresponding house sizes and connect the points to visualize the line.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the parameters of the linear function
weights = np.array([2, 3])  # weights for the features
bias = 1  # bias term

# Define the input features
features = np.array([1, 2])  # input features

# Compute the linear combination
linear_combination = np.dot(weights, features) + bias

print("Linear combination:", linear_combination)
```

In this example, we have a simple linear function with two input features (`features`) and two corresponding weights (`weights`). The linear combination is computed by taking the dot product of the weights and features and adding the bias term. Finally, the result is printed out.

## To-Do Exercise

Build a simple linear regression model using the [Kaggle housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harrywang/housing). The final graph should resemble something like this:
