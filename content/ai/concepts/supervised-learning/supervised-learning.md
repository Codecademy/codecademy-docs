**Supervised learning (ML)** is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data. It involves training a model on input-output pairs to generalize and predict outcomes for new, unseen data. This label acts as a "supervisor," guiding the learning process.

Imagine teaching a child by showing them examples with correct answers. Similarly, the algorithm learns patterns from these examples and uses them to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Examples: Identifying Handwritten Digits, predicting the prices of cars, spam emails detection.

## Types of Supervised Learning

### Classification

In Classification, the algorithm learns from labeled training data, where each input is associated with a specific class, and then uses this knowledge to classify new, unseen data.

- Example: In a spam filter, the classes are "spam" and "not spam."
  - Linear regression: Plots the line or plane of "best fit" of optimal values for prediction tasks.
  - Logistic regression: Classifies elements in a data set into discrete categories.
- Classification: Categorizes data points into discrete groups.
  - Na√Øve-Bayes classifier: Uses Bayes' theorem of probability to perform classification of elements.
  - Support vector machine (SVM): Margin classifiers that define hyperplanes to separate data points into discrete categories.
  - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): Classifiers modeled after biological neural networks with relatively high-performance capabilities in regression and classification tasks.

### Regression

Predicts numeric values.

- Clustering: Recognize patterns and structures in unlabeled data by grouping them into clusters.
  - K-Means: Categorizes data points into clusters based on their proximity to cluster centroids.
  - Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering: Groups data points into clusters based on various measures of similarity, such as the smallest average distance between all points, minimal variance between data points, or smallest maximum distance between data points.
- Dimensionality Reduction: Scale down the dimensions in the dataset from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space while maintaining the maximum amount of relevant information.
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces the dimensionality of a dataset to the 'n' number of principal dimensions that contain the most valuable information.
