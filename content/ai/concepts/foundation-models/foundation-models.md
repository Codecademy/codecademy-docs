**Foundation models** power AI systems that are trained on text, images, code, and other formats of data. These models train on large amounts of data from the internet.

## Risks

Due to the nature of the data that models train on, biases and stereotypes pose a serious risk. Malicious actors may spread disinformation. Misinformation is also a possibility due to artificial hallucinations.
