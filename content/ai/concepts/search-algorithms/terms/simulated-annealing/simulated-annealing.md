**Simulated Annealing** An optimization algorithm, used to solve an optimization problems which can contain many different solutions (by the process of slowly decreasing the probability of accepting worse solutions as the vest solution space is explored). Each solution has a different score & the goal of the algorithm is to find the best score over the course of the experiment.
