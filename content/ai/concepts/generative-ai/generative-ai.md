TODOTODO-synopsis
GenAI
learning frome existing data
unique outputs
highly realistic, complex, and stylized
where media is used -

## Generative AI

common tools
diffusion
LLM
step change
foundation model
styles
impact is big but tbd
tuning replaces tradtional NLP
applications

- text
- images
- music
- code
- others
  Produce works of art
  Become part of the creative process
  Photorealism
  Quickly visualize ideas
  Create unique images
  Character in scene

### What is intelligence?

AI meeting or exceeding intellegence of a human
discover, infer, reason
can win an art competition
is it art?
debated
skills not required - but modern art hasn't been about skills
emotions, creativity, intent - still driven by a person
analogy of photography

### How did we get here?

GANs to Diffusion
Noise->produce image->is it real or fake->feedback get better
Collect images
Noise in reverse
Random seed
Unique images are created
Geenrative ai->foundation models->LLMs
Add labeling to the foundation model, called tuning, - can then perform specific NL task
Prompting or prompt engineering - can use for specific NL task
Difficult and expensive to train an LLM
Foundation model shift and now using LLM
Before AI used separate specific models
Gives LLMs a superpower, unsupervised, unstructured, huge amount in the language domain

## Applications

### Text and Writing

GPT
Jasper
AI-Writer
Lex

### Images

DALLE-2
Midjourney
Imagery
Stable Diffusion

### Music

### Code

Code -> complete code as authored, Copilot

### Others

- Voice
- Scientific Research
- Chemistry
- 3D Models
- Video
- Chemistry -> molecule discovery
- Earth Science - climate research

## Impact and Possibilities

### Legality

Changes
Uniqueness
Different enough
Copyright and Immitation
Reference artist names, genres
Fair use
Use Identity/style

### Speed of change

Fear speed of change

### How we work

Mentorship
No more mundate parts of the creative process
can people just make the jump - no more like described image work

### Possibilities

How we create content, consumtion variations - movie example
Programming
TTS open up for youtube creation
Switchboards, human computers outdated new fields arrive
Understand more how creative processes work
