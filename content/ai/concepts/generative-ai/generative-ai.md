Generative AI or **GenAI**, based on Large Language Models **LLMs** is a rapidly changing technology involving with the creation of highly realistic, complex, stylized, unique media or creations from human initiated natural language prompts.

## Generative AI

**LLMs**, large language models trained on terabytes of textual data have allowed models to be created which can understand semantics and intent.

In the case of **ChatGPT** it was discovered with some additional training the LLM can be highly useable.

Generative AI is the connection of **LLMs** with other technologies to all the generation of media such as images, video, music, or code with text prompts and also media inputs. The output has the quality of photorealism. It allows creativity to quickly create new characters, scenes, and generate new ideas.

**GenAI** is being explored for things beyond media in fields as varied as molecule discovery for pharmaceuticals and 3D shape generation.

Things are changing quickly and the impact is only just starting to being predicted. Most people are expecting a step change in certain ways how we live and work.

### Foundation models

The changes is being driven by a new paradigm. Before AI applications were task specific. Now a single foundation model can drive multiple different tasks. Unstructured and unsupervised training. **LLMs** or large language models are foundation models.

The models have a generative ability and were the beginning of Generative AI. **ChatGPT** demonstrated abilities to generate and completed text.

Using this approach we can leverage the vast amount of pre-trained data with a small amount of additional **tuning** and **prompting**. Tuning adds labels into the data. Prompting bridges the gap between training and what we want. While training the LLM is expensive, the usage or **inference** leverages all the training but can be cost effective.

The breakthrough is leveraging these powerful **LLMs** to be used for generative AI not for just text generation but for many other generative purposes.

### The question of intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence **AI** is the matching or exceeding the intelligence of a human being. Things that we often associate with intelligence such as calculating mathematical problems, playing chess, or remembering vast amounts of data can already be done more quickly than a person could.

With LLMs and diffusion with random seeding we can now match or exceed other skills we often associate with intelligence such as understanding and then creating new text content including stories, poems, analyzing content, creating unique images or even art.

### Is it art?

In 2022 Jason Allen’s AI generated work, **Théâtre D’opéra Spatial,** won first place in the digital category at the Colorado State Fair. The artist did indicate that he used the **GenAI** platform **Midjourney** but it was discovered that the judges weren't familiar with the tool at the time of judging.

**GenAI** has opened up a number of discussions and debates about the consideration of is what is being created is art or not. Discussions recall how when photography was introduced into a world where painting has been considered art for millennia - it wasn't considered Art in it's own right. But now few people would argue that photography is an art.

One argument is that since there is no skill required in the creation of the art - the years artists must hone their skills is not present it isn't art - but yet modern art has been about concept not skill.

Another argument is that the human element is not present in **GenAI** created works - but the counter argument is that the creation is still driven by a person who inputs emotion, creativity, and intent.

## Applications

Generative AI is a combination of several technologies and has many applications. Effective LLMs are used to understand a natural language prompt and a technologies such as **Diffusion models** in the case of image generation.

### Text and Writing

One of the first Generative AI mediums people think of is text and writing. Having ChatGPT generate poems or the summary of a meeting. Generative AI can create blogs, write ad copy, create new content based on text input, and is great at summarizing and changing the style and tone of text content.

Some common tools include:

- GPT
- Jasper
- AI-Writer
- Lex

### Images

People can create or edit new images from existing text and images. There is a random seed so the images are unique new creations. Image creation is mainly based on a relatively new development called Diffusion. What is a diffusion model?

#### Diffusion models

**GANs** or were the standard way to create images until recently. Random noise is used to create an image. The image is then fed into another network which is trained to determine the quality. Then both become better.

Diffusion models are instead inspired by the world of physics. Think of opening a bottle of perfume on one side of a large room. Eventually the molecules we smell diffuse into the air in the room. The noisy track of the molecules can be reversed back to the bottle.

The text is interpreted and used by an image creator which is a diffusion model.

- DALL-E
- Midjourney
- Imagery
- Stable Diffusion

### Music

**GenAI** allows for the creation of long playing high-fidelity music from text descriptions and additional sound input conditions.

The recorded hum a melody and turn it into song being played by guitar. We can change the style of any melody or song to for example Jazz, Rock, or computer music.

Inputs can also be stories, or images and music even created from different media.

Some common tools include Mubert Studio, Jukebox from OpenAI, and MusicLM from Google.

### Code

Coding was one of the first areas commercialized with **GenAI**. Github released Copilot X which act as an AI paired programmer. Some features include:

- Code completion
- Chat ability with Copilot and ask things it to explain what the code does or write unit tests for you.
- Answer questions based on **docs**
- Copilot is integrated into large **docs** systems such as **MDN**
- Voice coding
- Fill in text in pull requests for things like summaries and descriptions

**GenAI** for coding offers many future possibilities as Generative AI has proven to be successful in mundane involved tasks such as connecting different computer systems together by understanding the protocols involved without having to map fields and values manually. Some other uses include:

- Bug fixing
- Code refactoring
- Style fixing
- Application UI development

### Other areas

While **GenAI** is generally discussed in the context of Text, Images, Music, and Coding there are many other active areas. Some of these include.

- Voice such as high fidelity text to speech
- Scientific Discovery - generating hypothesis, accelerating discovery
- Chemistry - molecule and drug discovery
- Medical imaging
- 3D Models - text to space creation
- Video - movies, animations, transition between real and generated
- Education - personalizing, customizing lessons, tutoring
- Many others!

## Impact and Possibilities

### Legality

The legal aspects of Generative AI is not yet defined. Class action lawsuits due to training data showing up infringing on the rights of artists.

Freedom of expression, in the US fair use allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission of the copyright holder.

Such as commentary, search engines, news reporting, research so copyright law not to rigid. Transformative which is defined as a new expression, meaning, or message to the work.

### Policy

Different companies are quickly setting up polices around Generative AI. Google announced that they are allowing AI generated advertising content. Shutterstock has announced that they will allow the selling content generated with OpenAI only and are working on a royalty system for content used to sell generated content based on original work.

### Speed of change

What is different about Generative AI is the speed of change. This is creating fear of the unknown as it is difficult to predict what will happen next. Digital artists and some prominent tech leaders are calling for the halting of Generative AI until the impacts on society are more understood.

### How we work

Generative AI is expected to have significant impacts on the working world. Directly hundreds of millions of jobs will be affected.

In some sense the change is expected to be welcome as jobs that are currently mundane or have been difficult to automate will go away. For example frame editing, common artwork generation, and basic copywriting.

One concern with this reduction is how jobs typically mentor juniors. If the mundane entry work goes away - how will the next generation be trained?

### Possibilities

While any new disruptive technology creates a lot of uncertainties many people are also excited about what the future may bring.

Generative AI may open up entirely new ways we can create and consume content. For example media now is difficult and time consuming to create even just in one length and format. Generative AI may allow different versions of movies, stories, and short videos to be generated from the same source media to allow new ways of media consumption.

Generation of speech based on text with high fidelity style will allow creates to make content where they were limited by voice overlay before.

Code generation, while automating repetitive work may result in higher quality code and the focus on new creative user centric solutions.

Movies and video creation once expensive and available through large studios and digital production groups can instead be created by individuals and bound only by their imagination.

Content may be connected back through the block chain to compensate original creators.

Generative AI may help people understand more how creative processes work in general and how to continually enhance the human process.
