People can generate new images from existing text prompts and images. There is a random seed so the images are unique new creations. **GenAI** uses **diffusion models** to create new unique images.

#### Diffusion models

Image creation is mainly based on a relatively new development called Diffusion. What is a diffusion model?

**GANs** or were the standard way to create images until recently. Random noise is used to create an image. The image is then fed into another network which is trained to determine the quality. Then both become better.

Diffusion models are instead inspired by the world of physics. Think of opening a bottle of perfume on one side of a large room. Eventually the molecules we smell diffuse into the air in the room. The noisy track of the molecules can be reversed back to the bottle.

The text is interpreted and used by an image creator which is a diffusion model.
