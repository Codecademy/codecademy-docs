Coding was one of the first areas commercialized with **GenAI**.

### Code

Github released Copilot X which act as an AI paired programmer. Some features include:

- Code completion
- Chat ability with Copilot and ask things it to explain what the code does or write unit tests for you.
- Answer questions based on **docs**
- Copilot is integrated into large **docs** systems such as **MDN**
- Voice coding
- Fill in text in pull requests for things like summaries and descriptions

**GenAI** for coding offers many future possibilities as Generative AI has proven to be successful in mundane involved tasks such as connecting different computer systems together by understanding the protocols involved without having to map fields and values manually. Some other uses include:

- Bug fixing
- Code refactoring
- Style fixing
- Application UI development
