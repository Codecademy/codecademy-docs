**Generative AI** (GenAI) involves the creation of complex, intricate, and realistic digital media. Before **GenAI** digital media of this level could only be created by human beings. These unique creations are driven by natural language prompts.

## Generative AI

**GenAI** is based on **Large Language Models** (LLMs). **LLMs** are trained on terabytes of textual data from the Internet. This models have the capability of understanding human language semantics and intent.

In the case of **ChatGPT**, one breakthrough was the discovery that with some additional training the **LLMs** can be easily used to produce impressive text based results.

**GenAI** is the connection of **LLMs** with technologies that in addition to text results can generate digital media such as images, video, music, or code.

There is exploration of going beyond digital media and use this technology for things as varied as the discovery of new molecules and 3D designs.

Things are changing quickly and the impact is only just starting to being predicted and felt. Most people are expecting a step change in certain ways how we live and work.

### Foundation models

In the past, AI applications were very task specific. The recent technology shift has been to use large **foundation models** to drive a number of different tasks. Large amounts of unstructured and unsupervised training is used to create the **foundation model**. **LLMs** are a type of **foundation model**.

The models have a generative ability and were the start of **Generative AI**. **ChatGPT** demonstrated the ability to generate and completed natural language prompts.

Using the concept of **foundation models** we can leverage the vast amount of pre-trained data with a small amount of additional **tuning** and **prompting**. **Tuning** adds labels into the data. **Prompting** bridges the gap between training and our intention. While training the **LLM** is expensive, the usage referred to as **inference** is more cost effective.

### The question of intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence **AI** is the matching or exceeding the intelligence of a human being. Things that we often associate with intelligence such as doing math, playing chess, or remembering vast amounts of data already can be done more quickly better than a person can.

With **LLMs** and a technology called **diffusion** AI systems can now match or exceed other skills we often associate with intelligence such as:

-Understanding and creating new text content.
-Writing never before created stories and poems.
-Analyzing content for tone and emotions.
-Creating unique images and video.

### Is it art?

In 2022 Jason Allen’s AI generated work, Théâtre D’opéra Spatial, won first place in the digital category at the Colorado State Fair. The artist did indicate that he used the **GenAI** platform **Midjourney**. It was later discovered that the judges weren't familiar with the tool at the time of judging.

The question does **GenAI** create art is now being asked. Parallels are being drawn. When photography was introduced, only painting had ever been considered art. Photography wasn't considered art and the same discussion took place. Now, few people would argue that photography can be art.

Another argument is that since there is no advanced skill required from the operator. Some consider are the application of skills developed over many years. However, modern art has been about concept and technique - not necessarily skill.

An additional argument is that the human element is not present in **GenAI** created works. The counter argument is that the creation is still driven by a person who has emotion, creativity, and intent.

## Applications

Generative AI is a combination of several technologies and has many applications. Effective LLMs are used to understand a natural language prompt and a technologies such as **Diffusion models** in the case of image generation.

### Text and Writing

One of the first Generative AI mediums people think of is text and writing. Having ChatGPT generate poems or the summary of a meeting. Generative AI can create blogs, write ad copy, create new content based on text input, and is great at summarizing and changing the style and tone of text content.

Some common tools include:

- GPT
- Jasper
- AI-Writer
- Lex

### Images

People can create or edit new images from existing text and images. There is a random seed so the images are unique new creations. Image creation is mainly based on a relatively new development called Diffusion. What is a diffusion model?

#### Diffusion models

**GANs** or were the standard way to create images until recently. Random noise is used to create an image. The image is then fed into another network which is trained to determine the quality. Then both become better.

Diffusion models are instead inspired by the world of physics. Think of opening a bottle of perfume on one side of a large room. Eventually the molecules we smell diffuse into the air in the room. The noisy track of the molecules can be reversed back to the bottle.

The text is interpreted and used by an image creator which is a diffusion model.

- DALL-E
- Midjourney
- Imagery
- Stable Diffusion

### Music

**GenAI** allows for the creation of long playing high-fidelity music from text descriptions and additional sound input conditions.

The recorded hum a melody and turn it into song being played by guitar. We can change the style of any melody or song to for example Jazz, Rock, or computer music.

Inputs can also be stories, or images and music even created from different media.

Some common tools include Mubert Studio, Jukebox from OpenAI, and MusicLM from Google.

### Code

Coding was one of the first areas commercialized with **GenAI**. Github released Copilot X which act as an AI paired programmer. Some features include:

- Code completion
- Chat ability with Copilot and ask things it to explain what the code does or write unit tests for you.
- Answer questions based on **docs**
- Copilot is integrated into large **docs** systems such as **MDN**
- Voice coding
- Fill in text in pull requests for things like summaries and descriptions

**GenAI** for coding offers many future possibilities as Generative AI has proven to be successful in mundane involved tasks such as connecting different computer systems together by understanding the protocols involved without having to map fields and values manually. Some other uses include:

- Bug fixing
- Code refactoring
- Style fixing
- Application UI development

### Other areas

While **GenAI** is generally discussed in the context of Text, Images, Music, and Coding there are many other active areas. Some of these include.

- Voice such as high fidelity text to speech
- Scientific Discovery - generating hypothesis, accelerating discovery
- Chemistry - molecule and drug discovery
- Medical imaging
- 3D Models - text to space creation
- Video - movies, animations, transition between real and generated
- Education - personalizing, customizing lessons, tutoring
- Many others!

## Impact and Possibilities

### Legality

The legal aspects of Generative AI is not yet defined. Class action lawsuits due to training data showing up infringing on the rights of artists.

Freedom of expression, in the US fair use allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission of the copyright holder.

Such as commentary, search engines, news reporting, research so copyright law not to rigid. Transformative which is defined as a new expression, meaning, or message to the work.

### Policy

Different companies are quickly setting up polices around Generative AI. Google announced that they are allowing AI generated advertising content. Shutterstock has announced that they will allow the selling content generated with OpenAI only and are working on a royalty system for content used to sell generated content based on original work.

### Speed of change

What is different about Generative AI is the speed of change. This is creating fear of the unknown as it is difficult to predict what will happen next. Digital artists and some prominent tech leaders are calling for the halting of Generative AI until the impacts on society are more understood.

### How we work

Generative AI is expected to have significant impacts on the working world. Directly hundreds of millions of jobs will be affected.

In some sense the change is expected to be welcome as jobs that are currently mundane or have been difficult to automate will go away. For example frame editing, common artwork generation, and basic copywriting.

One concern with this reduction is how jobs typically mentor juniors. If the mundane entry work goes away - how will the next generation be trained?

### Possibilities

While any new disruptive technology creates a lot of uncertainties many people are also excited about what the future may bring.

Generative AI may open up entirely new ways we can create and consume content. For example media now is difficult and time consuming to create even just in one length and format. Generative AI may allow different versions of movies, stories, and short videos to be generated from the same source media to allow new ways of media consumption.

Generation of speech based on text with high fidelity style will allow creates to make content where they were limited by voice overlay before.

Code generation, while automating repetitive work may result in higher quality code and the focus on new creative user centric solutions.

Movies and video creation once expensive and available through large studios and digital production groups can instead be created by individuals and bound only by their imagination.

Content may be connected back through the block chain to compensate original creators.

Generative AI may help people understand more how creative processes work in general and how to continually enhance the human process.
