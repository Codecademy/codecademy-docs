**Coding** was one of the first areas commercialized with GenAI.

## Code

GitHub released Copilot X which acts as an AI-paired programmer. Some features include:

- Code completion.
- Chat ability with Copilot and ask things it to explain what the code does or write unit tests for you.
- Answer questions based on documentation.
- Copilot is integrated into large documentation systems such as MDN.
- Voice coding.
- Fill-in-text in pull requests for things like summaries and descriptions.

GenAI for coding offers many future possibilities. Generative AI can complete mundane tasks (such as connecting different computer systems) by understanding the protocols involved without having to map fields and values manually. Some other uses include:

- Bug fixing
- Code refactoring.
- Style fixing
- Application UI development
