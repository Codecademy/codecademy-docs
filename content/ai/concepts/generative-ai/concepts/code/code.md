**Coding** was one of the first areas commercialized with GenAI.

## Code

Generative AI is at an early stage. It often yields impressive, but not perfect results. The best workflow is where generated output can be further reviewed and improved. For example, GitHub has released Copilot X which acts as an AI-paired programmer. Some features include:

- Code completion.
- Chat ability that can explain what the code does.
- Ability to generate unit tests.
- Answer questions based on existing documentation such as MDN; a major open source web technology documentation site.
- Voice coding.
- Fill-in-the-text parts of pull requests; for example the summary and description.

GenAI for coding offers many future possibilities. It's showing promise in many areas such as writing functional code blocks, building user interfaces, and even connecting different systems by mapping fields and values. Some other uses include:

- Bug fixing
- Code refactoring.
- Style fixing
- Web site creation.
- Creating fast prototypes.
