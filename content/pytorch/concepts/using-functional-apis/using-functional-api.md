**Functional APIs** in PyTorch provide a flexible and powerful way to define and manipulate neural networks. Unlike the `torch.nn.Module` class, which uses an object-oriented approach, functional APIs allow you to define models using functions. This can be particularly useful for creating complex models, experimenting with new architectures, or when you need more control over the forward pass.

## Key Concepts

### Functional Layers

Functional layers are stateless and do not store parameters. Instead, parameters are passed explicitly. This can be useful for creating custom layers or when you need to reuse the same layer with different parameters.
## Syntax

```pseudo
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

output = F.layer_name(input, *parameters, **kwargs)
## Example

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Define input tensor
x = torch.randn(10, 3)

# Define weights and bias
weight = torch.randn(5, 3, requires_grad=True)
bias = torch.randn(5, requires_grad=True)

# Apply linear transformation
output = F.linear(x, weight, bias)
```
The code will output a tensor of shape `(10, 5)` representing the result of the linear transformation. However, the actual values of the tensor will be random due to the use of `torch.randn`, which generates random values from a normal distribution. 

The output might look like this:

```shell
tensor([[-1.1570, -1.0890, -0.4154, -0.1795,  1.6989],
        [-0.5629, -0.3360, -0.3411, -0.2352,  1.0300],
        [-0.3185,  0.2398,  0.5389,  0.2491,  1.0749],
        ...
        [ 0.0665,  0.4579, -0.1494, -0.5361,  0.7465],
        [-0.5970,  0.3147,  0.1569,  0.1582,  0.5355],
        [-0.4481, -0.5795,  0.4445, -0.0623,  0.7024]])
### Custom Loss Functions

Using functional APIs, you can easily define custom loss functions. This is useful when the predefined loss functions in PyTorch do not meet your requirements.
## Syntax

```pseudo
import torch

def custom_loss(output, target):
    # Define the loss calculation
    loss = some_loss_function(output, target)
    return loss
Example:
```python
def custom_loss(output, target):
    loss = torch.mean((output - target) ** 2)
    return loss

# Example usage
output = torch.randn(10, 5)
target = torch.randn(10, 5)
loss = custom_loss(output, target)
print("Custom MSE Loss:", loss)
```

### Activation Functions

PyTorch provides a variety of activation functions in the `torch.nn.functional` module. These can be used to add non-linearity to your models.

Example:
```python
x = torch.randn(10, 5)

# Apply ReLU activation
output = F.relu(x)
```

## Advantages of Using Functional APIs

1. **Flexibility**: Functional APIs provide more control over the forward pass and allow for easy experimentation with different architectures.
2. **Reusability**: Since functional layers are stateless, they can be reused with different parameters without any side effects.
3. **Customizability**: Easily define custom layers, loss functions, and activation functions to suit your specific needs.

## Conclusion

Functional APIs in PyTorch offer a powerful and flexible way to define and manipulate neural networks. By understanding and utilizing these APIs, you can create more complex and customized models, experiment with new architectures, and have greater control over the forward pass.
