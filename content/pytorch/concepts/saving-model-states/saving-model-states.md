# Saving Model States in PyTorch

Saving model states in PyTorch is a crucial concept for preserving the progress of your model during training. It allows you to save a model's parameters, optimizer states, and other important metadata so that you can resume training or use the model for inference later. This is especially useful in scenarios where training is computationally expensive, or when you need to deploy your model in a production environment.

## Syntax

PyTorch provides the `torch.save` and `torch.load` functions to handle saving and loading model states. Typically, a model's state dictionary is saved using:

```python
import torch

torch.save(model.state_dict(), PATH)
```

And loaded using:

```python
model.load_state_dict(torch.load(PATH))
model.eval()  # Set model to evaluation mode if using it for inference
```

---

## Example

### Saving and Loading Model States

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Initialize model and optimizer
model = SimpleModel()
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Define a path to save the model
model_path = "simple_model.pth"

# Simulate training by updating model parameters
for _ in range(5):
    # Fake inputs and loss
    inputs = torch.randn(1, 10)
    target = torch.randn(1, 2)

    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(inputs)
    loss = ((output - target) ** 2).mean()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Save model state and optimizer state
state = {
    'model_state': model.state_dict(),
    'optimizer_state': optimizer.state_dict(),
}
torch.save(state, model_path)

print(f"Model state saved at {model_path}")

# Load model and optimizer states
checkpoint = torch.load(model_path)
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state'])
optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint['optimizer_state'])
print("Model and optimizer states loaded.")

# Ensure model is in evaluation mode for inference
model.eval()

# Make a prediction
example_input = torch.randn(1, 10)
example_output = model(example_input)
print("Prediction:", example_output)
```

In this example:

- The model's state dictionary and optimizer's state dictionary are saved into a file named `simple_model.pth`.
- The model and optimizer states are loaded back from the saved file, ensuring seamless resumption of training or use of the model for inference.

---

By using the `torch.save` and `torch.load` functions along with the state dictionary, you can effectively manage model checkpoints and ensure a reproducible workflow.
