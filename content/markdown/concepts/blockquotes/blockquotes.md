_Blockquotes_ indicate that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. They can also be used to bring attention to a thought-provoking quote. Any quotation that is 50 words or longer should be formatted as a blockquote.

To create a blockquote, add a right angle bracket `>` in front of a paragraph.

```
> Context and memory play powerful roles in all the truly great meals in one's life.
```

The rendered output would look like this:

> Context and memory play powerful roles in all the truly great meals in one's life.

## Multiple Paragraphs

Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a `>` on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

```
> The first rule about fight club is you don’t talk about fight club.
> 
> The second rule about fight club is you don’t talk about fight club.
```

## Nested Blockquotes

Blockquotes can be nested. Add a `>>` in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

```
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

## Blockquotes with Other Elements

Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used — you’ll need to experiment to see which ones work.

> #### The quarterly results look great.
>
> - Dogecoin was off the chart!
> - Apes together stonk!
> - AMC to the moon!
> 
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.
