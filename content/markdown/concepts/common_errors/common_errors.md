# Common Errors in Markdown

As new users of Markdown, we are in a good position to make lists of those common mistakes that newbies (like us) make. I'm going to be very vulnerable here and add all the mistakes, big and small, that I make just as I learn Markdown to create this file.

<br>
Let's start a list!  
<br>
<br>  
  
+Forgetting to leave a space after the "#" for headings\ OOPS!  
+ And forgetting to leave a space after the symbol for bullets
+ Forgetting all the many ways to create a line break. I had to look it up just to make this file.
+ Doing a commit for every little change so that you can preview it in github... Visual Studio can show you in real time. Probably everyone else already knew that.

## Add your mistakes as you make them.
