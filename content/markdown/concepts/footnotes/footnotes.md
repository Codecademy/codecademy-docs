In Markdown,**footnotes** are subscript numbers to add notes and references to documentation in a way that keeps the content organized.

## Syntax

In Markdown, short footnotes uses the following syntax,

```md
This is a text[^1]
[^1]: This is a reference.
```

For footnotes that are more than a sentence, use the following syntax:

```md
[^bignote]: This is a reference that is used to correlate it to the document. It is best to read it alongside the paragraph it is used to help users gain a better understanding of the documentation.
```

## Example 1

In the below example, the sentence compares the tool, Pieces to Tinkerbell, and its footnotes elaborate on who Tinkerbell is. This is done to make the correlation clearer for a user who might not be familiar with this character.
Think of Pieces as a technical Tinkerbell from Peter Pan[^2]

[^2]: This is a fairytale about a forever young boy would takes a group of British children to his home island, Neverland

When rendered, it looks like this
```md
> Think of Pieces as a technical Tinkerbell from Peter Pan[^2]
```
## Things to consider when using Footnotes

When writing documentation, consider the following strategies to use footnotes effectively:

- Don't add a space between the word and the number that has the caret next to it and is encased in brackets  It'll make the footnote not appear.
- Using them sporadically as footnotes can make it difficult for users to navigate documentation to determine if the sentence can be easily comprehended.
