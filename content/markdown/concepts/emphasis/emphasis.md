Emphasis can be added by making text bold or italic.

## Bold

To bold text, add two asterisks `*` or underscores `_` before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

```
**bold text**
```

```
__bold text__
```

## Bold Best Practices

Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word. For compatibility, use asterisks to bold the middle of a word for emphasis.

To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.
