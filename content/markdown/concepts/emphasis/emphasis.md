Emphasis can be added by making text bold or italic.

## Bold

To bold text, add two asterisks `**` or underscores `__` before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

```markdown
**bold text**
```

```markdown
**bold text**
```

For example:

```markdown
Please do **NOT** touch your pimples.
```

## Italic

To italicize text, add one asterisk `*` or underscore `_` before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

```markdown
\*_italic text_
```

```markdown
_italic text_
```

For example:

```markdown
This avacado egg sandwich is _very_ good.
```
