In Markdown, items can be organized into ordered and unordered lists.

## Ordered Lists

To create an ordered list, add numbers followed by periods. 

```
1. Preheat oven to 325°F 👨🏻‍🍳
2. Drop cookie dough 🍪
3. Bake for 15 min ⏰
```

The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

It will look like:

1. Preheat oven to 325°F 👨🏻‍🍳
2. Drop cookie dough 🍪
3. Bake for 15 min ⏰

## Unordered Lists

To create an unordered list, add dashes `-`, asterisks `*`, or plus signs `+` in front of line items. 

```
- Play more music 🎸
- Read more books 📚
- Code more stuff 👩🏼‍💻
```

It will look like:

- Play more music 🎸
- Read more books 📚
- Code more stuff 👩🏼‍💻

Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

```
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
  - Indented item
  - Indented item
- Fourth item
```
