In Markdown, items can be organized into ordered and unordered lists.

## Ordered Lists

To create an ordered list, add numbers followed by periods. 

```
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item
```

The numbers donâ€™t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

It will look like:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

## Unordered Lists

To create an unordered list, add dashes `-`, asterisks `*`, or plus signs `+` in front of line items. 

```
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item
```

It will look like:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

```
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
  - Indented item
  - Indented item
- Fourth item
```
