Headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display with markdown. There is a total of 6 different headings.

To create a heading, add hashtag signs `#` in front of a word or phrase. 

The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three `<h3>`, use three number signs (e.g., `### My Header`).

## Syntax

```
# Heading level 1

## Heading level 2

### Heading level 3

#### Heading level 4

##### Heading level 5

###### Heading level 6
```

# Heading level 1	

## Heading level 2	

### Heading level 3	

#### Heading level 4	

##### Heading level 5	

<h6>Heading level 6</h6>	

## Alternate Syntax

Alternatively, on the line below the text:

- Add any number of `==` characters for heading level 1 
- Add any number or `--` characters for heading level 2.

```
Heading level 1
===============	

Heading level 2
---------------	
```

## Best Practices

Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (`#`) and the heading name. 

For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name.

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
| --- | --- |
| `# Here's a Heading` | `#Here's a Heading` |

You should also put blank lines before and after a heading for compatibility.

```
... text ends here.

# Heading

More text starts here.
```
