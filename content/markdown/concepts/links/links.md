To create a link, enclose the link alt text in square brackets `[Alt text]` and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses `(https://website-name.com)`.

```
[Alt text](https://website-name.com)
```

For example:

```
We just launched [Codecademy Docs](https://producthunt.com) on Product Hunt!
```

The output would look like:

We just launched [Codecademy Docs](https://producthunt.com) on Product Hunt!

## Link Titles

A title for a link can be optionally added. This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in parentheses after the URL.

```
My favorite Craigslist categorey is [Missed Connections](https://newyork.craigslist.org/d/missed-connections/search/mis "The best place on the internet").
```

The output would look like:

My favorite Craigslist categorey is [Missed Connections](https://newyork.craigslist.org/d/missed-connections/search/mis "The best place on the internet").

## URLs and Email Addresses

To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets `<` `>`.

- `<https://www.markdownguide.org>`
- `<fake@gmail.com>`

The rendered output looks like this:

- https://www.markdownguide.org
- fake@gmail.com
