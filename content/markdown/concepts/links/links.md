To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., `[Duck Duck Go]`) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://duckduckgo.com)).

```
My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).
```

The output looks like this:

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).

## Adding Titles

You can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in parentheses after the URL.

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "The best search engine for privacy").
The rendered output looks like this:

My favorite search engine is Duck Duck Go.
