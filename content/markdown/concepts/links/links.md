To create a link, enclose the link alt text in square brackets `[Alt text]` and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses `(https://website-name.com)`.

```
[Alt text](https://website-name.com)
```

For example:

```
We just launched [Codecademy Docs](https://producthunt.com) on Product Hunt!
```

The output looks like this:

We just launched [Codecademy Docs](https://producthunt.com) on Product Hunt!

## Adding Titles

You can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in parentheses after the URL.

```
My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "The best search engine for privacy").
```

The rendered output looks like this:

My favorite search engine is Duck Duck Go.

## URLs and Email Addresses

To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.

<https://www.markdownguide.org>
<fake@example.com>

The rendered output looks like this:

https://www.markdownguide.org
fake@example.com
