To embed an image, add an exclamation mark `!`, followed by the alt text in square brackets `[Alt text]`, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses `(` `)`. 

```
![Alt text](URL or file path)
```

For example:

```
![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)
```

An optional title can also be added after the URL, still in the parentheses:

```
![The San Juan Mountains are beautiful!](/assets/images/san-juan-mountains.jpg "San Juan Mountains")
```

## Linked Images

To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses.

```
[![An old rock in the desert](/assets/images/shiprock.jpg "Shiprock, New Mexico by Beau Rogers
```
