To embed an image, add an exclamation mark `!`, followed by the alt text in square brackets `[Alt text]`, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses `(` `)`. 

```
![Alt text](URL or file path)
```

For example:

```
![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)
```

An optional title can also be added after the URL, still in the parentheses.
