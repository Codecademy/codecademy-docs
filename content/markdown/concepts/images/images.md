Embedding an image is very similar to adding a link in Markdown:

```
![Alt text](URL or file path)
```
- Add an exclamation mark `!`
- Followed by the alt text in square brackets `[Alt text]`
- And the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses `(` `)`. 

For example:

```
![Image of Codey](https://codecademy.com/images/codey.png)
```

An optional title can also be added after the URL, still in the parentheses:

```
![The San Juan Mountains are beautiful!](/assets/images/san-juan-mountains.jpg "San Juan Mountains")
```

## Linked Images

To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses.

```
[![An old rock in the desert](/assets/images/shiprock.jpg "Shiprock, New Mexico by Beau Rogers")](https://codecademy.com)
```
