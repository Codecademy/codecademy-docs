The **`DayOfWeek`** method is used to return the `DayOfWeek` instance for the weekday number, starting with `1` as `Monday`.

## Syntax

```pseudo
fun DayOfWeek(isoDayNumber: Int): DayOfWeek
```

- The `integer` value input into the method must correspond to one of the seven days in the `DayOfWeek` enumeration class. The numbering follows the ISO-8601 weekday number, where `Monday` is `1` and `Sunday` is `7`.
- The enumeration class entries have two properties: `Name`, which is represented by a `string`, and the `Ordinal`, which is represented as an `integer`.

## Example

Here is an example of how to call the `DayOfWeek` method from main:

```kolin
import java.time.DayOfWeek

fun main() {
    val day = DayOfWeek.of(3)
    println(day)
}
```

The output will be:

```shell
Wednesday
```
