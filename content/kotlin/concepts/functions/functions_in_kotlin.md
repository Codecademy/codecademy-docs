## Functions in Kotlin

**Functions are essential part of any Kotlin program.** The Kotlin program has to start with `main()` function or there will be an error. **fun** is used to define a function in Kotlin but thear are also predefinec functions like println and print.

### Function **main()**

Function **main()** is the entry point to Kotlin programing and also required in every Kotlin program. The **main()** function is ment to include your code that you write and is not called anywhere.
```
fun main() {
  println("Hello World")
}
```
### Creating functions in Kotlin ###

User defined functions start with the **fun** keyword, followed by the function name, parameters(if there is any) and the function body which is enclose in curly braces

```
fun main() {

}
```
