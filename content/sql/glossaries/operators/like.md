## Definition
***
The `LIKE` operator allows the user to perform pattern matching on `string` data through the use of wildcard characters.

## Syntax
***
LIKE %

LIKE _
## Example 1
***
Use `LIKE` to pattern match any sequence of characters within the query :
```codebyte/sql
import random

print(random.randint(0, 50))
```

## Example 2
***
Use `randint()` to return a random number between `-25` and `25`:
```codebyte/sql
import random

print(random.randint(-25, 25))
```
