## Definition 

A conditional statement similar to `WHERE` but used with aggregate functions (`COUNT()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`).

## Code Example

To return a result set of the number (count) of students from each country if the total number is less than 25:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(student_name),
  birth_country
FROM students
GROUP BY birth_country
HAVING COUNT(student_name) < 25;
```
