The **`BETWEEN`** [operator](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/sql/operators) is used to find values within a given range. The values can be texts, dates, or numbers. Also, this operator is _inclusive_, i.e., both beginning and ending values are included.

## Syntax

```pseudo
SELECT column_name(s) from table_name where column_name between value1 and value2;
```

> Note: The basic syntax for `BETWEEN` is generally same across most databases, but some differences may arise depending on how each database handles specific [data types](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/sql/data-types) or expressions. To use this operator on a particular database, concepts such as _data handling_, _null handling_, _case sensitivity_, and _collations_ need to be checked first to avoid errors.

## Example

Suppose thereâ€™s a `bodega` table with the following data:

| order_id | item         | price | quantity | order_date          |
| -------- | ------------ | ----- | -------- | ------------------- |
| 1        | Donut        | 2.49  | 2        | 2022-08-16 08:04:23 |
| 2        | Cookie       | 0.99  | 3        | 2022-08-21 09:43:00 |
| 3        | Donut        | 2.49  | 1        | 2022-08-18 11:25:12 |
| 4        | Egg Sandwich | 7.99  | 1        | 2022-08-20 11:45:41 |
| 5        | Ice Coffee   | 3.99  | 2        | 2022-08-17 12:18:50 |

Here is a query using the `BETWEEN` operator:

```sql
SELECT * FROM bodega WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2022-08-15' AND '2022-08-19';
```

This would return all records from the `bodega` table, where the `order_date` is between _August 15, 2022_ and _August 19, 2022_ (inclusive):

| order_id | item       | price | quantity | order_date          |
| -------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | ------------------- |
| 1        | Donut      | 2.49  | 2        | 2022-08-16 08:04:23 |
| 3        | Donut      | 2.49  | 1        | 2022-08-18 11:25:12 |
| 5        | Ice Coffee | 3.99  | 2        | 2022-08-17 12:18:50 |
