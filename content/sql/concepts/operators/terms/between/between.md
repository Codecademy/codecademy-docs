Selects values, inclusively of beginning and end values, within a given range. BETWEEN works with numbers, text, or date data types.

## Code Example

Suppose we want to get students with GPA between 0 and 2 in an ascending order:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM students
WHERE gpa BETWEEN 0.0 AND 1.99
ORDER BY gpa;
```
