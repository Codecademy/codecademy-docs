Title: ATAN Function
Description: Explanation and usage of the ATAN function in SQL.
---

The **`ATAN()`** function in SQL is a mathematical function utilized to compute the arctangent of a provided number. It evaluates the angle, measured in radians, whose tangent corresponds to the specified number. This function finds its utility in numerous mathematical and analytical calculations, such as determining angles or performing trigonometric operations within SQL queries.

The **`ATAN()`** function is widely supported across various SQL database systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. Its availability in these systems enables users to perform complex calculations involving angles and trigonometry directly within their SQL queries, providing a convenient and efficient means of processing numerical data. Whether it's calculating the inclination of lines, performing geometric transformations, or solving problems involving angles, the `ATAN()` function proves to be a valuable tool for mathematical computations within the SQL environment.

## Syntax

The syntax of the **`ATAN()`** function in SQL is as follows:

```sql
ATAN(expression)
```

- If the input expression is a numeric value, the **`ATAN()`** function returns the arctangent of that value in radians.
- If the input expression is `NULL`, the **`ATAN()`** function also returns `NULL`.

## Example

This example calculates the arctangent of a specific value:

```sql
SELECT ATAN(1.5) AS Arctangent_Result;
```

In this SQL code example, the **`ATAN()`** function is used to compute the arctangent of the value 1.5. The result is given the alias "Arctangent_Result" using the AS keyword, which allows you to assign a name to the column representing the calculated value.

The **`SELECT`** statement is used to retrieve the result of the calculation. By executing this query, the database system will evaluate the arctangent of 1.5 and return the result. The specific output may vary depending on the database system and its default unit for angles (radians or degrees).

For instance, if you execute this code in MySQL, the output would be approximately 0.9828 if the output is in radians. If the output is in degrees, the result would be approximately 56.31 degrees. The exact output would depend on the database system and its configuration.

By using this code snippet as a basis, you can substitute different values inside the **`ATAN()`** function to calculate the arctangent of other numbers in your SQL queries. The resulting value can be retrieved with a specific alias to make the output more descriptive and meaningful.
