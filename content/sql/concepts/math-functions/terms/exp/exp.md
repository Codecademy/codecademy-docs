The EXP() math function in SQL is a built-in function which is used to calculate the base of the natural logarithm (e) to the power of a specified number. This allows the user to easily approximate the value of "e" raised to the power of a given number. The function works across multiple database systems, such as MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.

Syntax
```pseudo
EXP(x)
```

Parameters
- x (numeric): The number to which "e" should be raised

Usage
The EXP() function is used to calculate "e" to the power of the number specified as a parameter:
```sql
SELECT EXP(2);
```

Return Value
The EXP() function will return the value of "e" raised to the power of the number given as a parameter.

Potential Pitfalls
The EXP() function only accepts numeric values as parameters, so passing a non-numeric value will cause a warning to be thrown. Additionally, if the value passed as a parameter results in a too large of a number, then the resulting value may become inaccurate. 

Note: The EXP() math function is supported in various SQL database systems, such as MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.

Codebyte Example
```codebyte/sql
require '/path/to/codebytes-sdk-sql/autoload.php';

// Calculate the value of "e" raised to the power of 2
echo Codebyte\codebyteEvaluate('SELECT EXP(2);');
// Output: 7.3890560989306
