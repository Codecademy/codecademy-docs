**Data types** serve to define the nature of data a variable can store. Rust employs static typing, ensuring that variable types are known at compile time, aiding in the detection of potential errors before runtime. These data types are broadly categorized into two groups: primitive types and compound types.

## Primitive types || scala types

- Integer
- Floating-Point
- Boolean
- Character

## Compound Types

- tuples
- arrays

## Codebyte Example (if applicable)

```codebyte/js
# Example runnable code block.
console.log('Hello, World!');
```
