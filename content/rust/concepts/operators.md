Rust, being a powerful and expressive programming language, provides a variety of operators to perform different operations on data types.Understanding how these operators work is essential for writing efficient and concise Rust code.

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used for basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. Here's a quick overview:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = 10;
    let b = 3;

    // Addition
    let sum = a + b;
    println!("Sum: {}", sum);

    // Subtraction
    let difference = a - b;
    println!("Difference: {}", difference);

    // Multiplication
    let product = a * b;
    println!("Product: {}", product);

    // Division
    let quotient = a / b;
    println!("Quotient: {}", quotient);

    // Remainder
    let remainder = a % b;
    println!("Remainder: {}", remainder);
}

Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare values and return a boolean result. They are essential for making decisions in your code. Here are some examples:

rust
Copy code
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = 8;

    // Equality
    println!("Equal: {}", x == y);

    // Inequality
    println!("Not Equal: {}", x != y);

    // Greater than
    println!("Greater than: {}", x > y);

    // Less than
    println!("Less than: {}", x < y);

    // Greater than or equal to
    println!("Greater than or equal to: {}", x >= y);

    // Less than or equal to
    println!("Less than or equal to: {}", x <= y);
}

Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean values. They are crucial for creating conditional statements. Here's a glimpse:

rust
Copy code
fn main() {
    let is_sunny = true;
    let is_warm = false;

    // Logical AND
    println!("AND: {}", is_sunny && is_warm);

    // Logical OR
    println!("OR: {}", is_sunny || is_warm);

    // Logical NOT
    println!("NOT: {}", !is_sunny);
}

Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators manipulate individual bits of integers. They are particularly useful in low-level programming. Here's an example:

rust
Copy code
fn main() {
    let a = 0b1100;
    let b = 0b1010;

    // Bitwise AND
    println!("AND: {:b}", a & b);

    // Bitwise OR
    println!("OR: {:b}", a | b);

    // Bitwise XOR
    println!("XOR: {:b}", a ^ b);

    // Bitwise NOT
    println!("NOT: {:b}", !a);
}

Assignment Operators
Assignment operators combine arithmetic and bitwise operations with assignment. They are a concise way of performing operations and updating variables. Here's a demonstration:

rust
Copy code
fn main() {
    let mut num = 10;

    // Add and assign
    num += 5;
    println!("Add and assign: {}", num);

    // Subtract and assign
    num -= 3;
    println!("Subtract and assign: {}", num);

    // Multiply and assign
    num *= 2;
    println!("Multiply and assign: {}", num);

    // Divide and assign
    num /= 4;
    println!("Divide and assign: {}", num);

    // Bitwise AND and assign
    num &= 3;
    println!("Bitwise AND and assign: {}", num);
}
