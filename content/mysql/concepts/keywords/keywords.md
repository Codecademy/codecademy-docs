MySQL **keywords** are predefined words that have special meaning in the SQL language. They are used to perform various operations within the database, such as creating tables, inserting data, querying the database, updating records, and more.

Keywords define the structure and syntax of SQL queries. They help organize the commands in a way that the MySQL database can interpret and execute. Using keywords ensures that your SQL queries are standarized, this enhances readability and maintainability of your code.

## Common MySQL Keywords

Here's a table of some commonly used MySQL keywords along with their definitions:

| Keyword    | Definition                                                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SELECT`   | Retrieves data from one or more tables                           |
| `FROM`     | Specifies the table(s) to retrieve data from                     |
| `WHERE`    | Filters the results based on a condition                         |
| `INSERT`   | Adds new data into a table                                       |
| `UPDATE`   | Modifies existing data in a table                                |
| `DELETE`   | Removes data from a table                                        |
| `CREATE`   | Creates a new database object (e.g., table, index)               |
| `ALTER`    | Modifies the structure of an existing database object            |
| `DROP`     | Removes a database object                                        |
| `JOIN`     | Combines rows from two or more tables                            |
| `GROUP BY` | Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns       |
| `HAVING`   | Specifies a search condition for a group or an aggregate         |
| `ORDER BY` | Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order            |
| `LIMIT`    | Specifies the maximum number of rows to return in the result set |
| `UNION`    | Combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements        |

## Example

The following example demonstrates the use of few MySQL keywords:

```SQL
-- Create a new table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    position VARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    hire_date DATE
);

-- Insert a new employee
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, position, salary, hire_date)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'Software Engineer', 75000.00, '2024-05-25');

-- Select specific employees
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE position = 'Software Engineer';
```

The output of the above query is:

| first_name | last_name |
| ---------- | --------- |
| John       | Doe       |

## Best Practices

- **Consistent formatting**: Always write keywords in uppercase for better readability.
- **Proper naming conventions**: Avoid using keywords as names for tables or coumns. If necessary, use backticks to avoid syntax errors.
- **Comprehensive understanding**: Familiarize yourself with the list of reserved keywors to avoid unintentional errors in SQL queries.
