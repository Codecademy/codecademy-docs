MySQL **keywords** are predefined words that have special meaning in the SQL language. They are used to perform various operations within the database, such as creating tables, inserting data, querying the database, updating records, and more. Examples of MySQL keywords include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, and ALTER.

## Importance and Usage

Keywords define the structure and syntax of SQL queries. They help organize the commands in a way that the MySQL database can interpret and execute. Each keyword performs a specific function such as selecting data (`SELECT`), inserting new records (`INSERT`), or modifying existing records (`UPDATE`).
Using keywords ensures that your SQL queries are standarized, this enhances readability and maintainability of your code. 

## Syntax

### CREATE

```SQL
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    ...
);
```

### INSERT

```SQL
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

### SELECT

```SQL
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### UPDATE

```SQL
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

### DELETE

```SQL
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```


## Example

### CREATE

```SQL
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    position VARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    hire_date DATE
);
```

### INSERT

```SQL
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, position, salary, hire_date)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'Software Engineer', 75000.00, '2024-05-25');
```

### SELECT

```SQL
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE position = 'Software Engineer';
```

### UPDATE

```SQL
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 80000.00
WHERE id = 1;
```

### DELETE

```SQL
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE id = 1;
```


## Best Practices

**Consistent formatting**: Always write keywords in uppercase for better readability

**Proper naming conventions**: Avoid using keywords as names for tables or coumns. If necessary use, use backticks to avoid syntax errors.

**Comprehensive understanding**: Familiarize yourself with the list of reserved keywors to avoid unintentional errors in yout SQL queries.
