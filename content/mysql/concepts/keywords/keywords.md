# MySQL Keywords

MySQL **keywords** are predefined words that have special meaning in the SQL language. They are used to perform various operations within the database, such as creating tables, inserting data, querying the database, updating records, and more. Examples of MySQL keywords include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, and ALTER.

## Importance and Usage

Keywords define the structure and syntax of SQL queries. They help organize the commands in a way that the MySQL database can interpret and execute. Each keyword performs a specific function such as selecting data (`SELECT`), inserting new records (`INSERT`), or modifying existing records (`UPDATE`).
Using keywords ensures that your SQL queries are standarized, this enhances readability and maintainability of your code. 

### Example
```SQL
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```
```SQL
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);
```

## Common Keywords

**SELECT** : Used to retrieve data from one or more tables.
### Example:
```SQL
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```
**INSERT** : Used to add new records to a table.
### Example:
```SQL
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);
```
**UPDATE** : Used to modify existing records in a table.
### Example:
```SQL
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;
```
**DELETE** : Used to remove records from a table.
### Example:
```SQL
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**CREATE** : Used to create new tables or databases.
### Example:
```SQL
CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 datatype, column2 datatype);
```
**CREATE** : Used to delete tables or databases.
### Example:
```SQL
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

## Best Practices

**Consistent formatting**: Always write keywords in uppercase for better readability

**Proper naming conventions**: Avoid using keywords as names for tables or coumns. If necessary use, use backticks to avoid syntax errors.

**Comprehensive understanding**: Familiarize yourself with the list of reserved keywors to avoid unintentional errors in yout SQL queries.
