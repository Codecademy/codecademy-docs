This General section is home to all programming and computer-related concepts that are language-agnostic and do not belong in one of our broader topic areas such as [AI](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ai), [cybersecurity](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity), or [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source). These include universal foundational programming terminologies that are often shared among languages and frameworks. Here you will find entries from ["Computer Hardware"](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/computer-hardware), to ["Developer Tools"](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/developer-tools), to ["Historical Technical Figures"](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/historical-technical-figures).
