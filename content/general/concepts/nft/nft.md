A non-fungible token (NFT) acts as a digital representation to prove ownership for a digital good backed by blockchain technology.

The term "token" in the phrase "non-fungible token" refers to this digital representation. "Non-fungible" simply means "non-replaceable". It can't be replaced, is one of a kind, and is always unique.

For example, a 1 U.S. Dollar note is fungible because you are able to replace that note with another note. However, each NFT is always unique, and cannot be simply swapped for another different NFT, even if both are a representation of the same good. This means that non-fungible things can be far more valuable than fungible things.

## Minting an NFT

Creating an NFT is known as “minting”. Minting an NFT is the process of taking a piece of content and putting it on a digital registry. In this process, some critical information such as owner name, date, and time is placed on the blockchain. The most common blockchain for minting NFTs is Ethereum. A person can manage any NFTs that the person mints or owns through a crypto wallet.

A crypto wallet is a digital wallet used to store cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Minting or purchasing an NFT can only be done through a crypto wallet. The ownership history of an NFT is easily traceable, verifiable and can be seen by anyone using the blockchain.

As of now, NFTs are most often used to prove ownership over a digital good, but they have many other potential uses yet to be explored.
