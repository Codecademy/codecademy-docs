**Hacktoberfest** is an annual worldwide event that is held in October. It incentivizes developers to contribute to [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source) software development.

## Participation and Rewards

Developers can participate by making a specific number of pull requests (typically four) to any public GitHub repository by the last day in October.

Participants who successfully complete the required number of pull requests receive a reward.

While the event encourages contributions, it also emphasizes the importance of quality over quantity. Contributions should follow the guidelines of the respective open-source projects and be meaningful improvements or additions.
