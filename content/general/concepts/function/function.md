In programming, functions hold a distinct place among the [data types](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types). While, on the surface, functions are algorithms that yield results or produce side-effects, they are usually processed as objects of data. Because functions are derived from objects, their closest classification is with composite data types.

Many of today's languages, therefore, treat functions as first-class objects, which means:

* They can be assigned to variables.
* They can be passed as arguments to or returned by other functions.
