# Hexadecimal
Hexadecimal(hex, hex numbers, base-16) is a numeral system that uses a base of 16. A very similar number system we know is the decimal number system, which uses a base of 10. 

Decimal number system: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
Hexadec number system: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  A  B  C  D  E  F



## HEX COLOR SYSTEM
HTML and CSS uses hexadecimals to represent color and its intensity. Color displayed in hexadecimals is specified with red, green and blue: #RRGGBB. (R = red, G = green and B = blue)

For example, #0000FF is displayed as blue, because red and green are both set to its lowest value, 00, and blue is set to its highest value, FF. 

#FFFFFF or #FFF = white
#000000 or #000 = black

When a hex color uses eaqual values for red, green and blue, the color is always grey.
