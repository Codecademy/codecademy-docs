`Hexadecimal`(hex, hex numbers, or base-16) is a numeral system that uses a base of 16 as opposed to the standard decimal system, base 10. The two have the first ten digits in common, 0-9. The remaining digits 10-15 are represented by the letters A-F in base 16. The letters are case-insensitive.

## Syntax
A hexadecimal number is prefixed with `0x`.


## Hex Colors
Hex numbers often represent colors(hex colors) and are specified with `#RRGGBB`(red, green, and blue). One example of a hex color is `#0000FF` and represents the color blue. We know this because red and green is set to their lowest value, `00`, and blue set to their highest value, `FF`. A hex color is prefixed with `#`.

## Example

```css
h1 {
    color: #0000FF;
}
```
