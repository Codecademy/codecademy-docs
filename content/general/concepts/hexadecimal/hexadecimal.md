**Hexadecimal** (hex, hex numbers, or base-16) is a numeral system that uses a base of 16 as opposed to the standard decimal system, base 10. The two have the first ten digits in common, 0-9. The remaining digits 10-15 are represented by the letters A-F in base 16. The letters are case-insensitive.

## Power Of 2

Hexadecimal, as well as binary(base 2) and octal(base 8) number systems, have bases that are powers of 2. This makes it easy to convert between these systems. 


## Syntax

A hexadecimal number is prefixed with `0x`.


## Hex Colors

Hex numbers often represent colors(hex colors) and are specified with `#RRGGBB`(red, green, and blue). One example of a hex color is `#0000FF` and represents the color blue. We know this because red and green is set to their lowest value, `00`, and blue set to their highest value, `FF`. A hex color is prefixed with `#`.
