The **CICD Pipeline** is the combination of continuous integration, delivery and deployment of software development and application deployment. **CI** stands for **Continuous Integration**. This is the automation process for Developers.**CD** stands for both **Continous Delivery** and **Continuous Deployment**. Continuous Delivery is the automated delivery of code to the testing and development steps of the pipeline. These environments are usually in a repository like [Github](https://www.github.com). Continuous Deployment refers to code passing automated tests and then automatically placed in production, which in turn is used for automatic deployment. The four main steps of the pipeline are: 

1. Source - The creation of code by developers, which is continuously integrated within a shared repository. Version control systems, like [Git] (https://git-scm.com/) are used for tracking and managing changes to the software. When changes are commited to the repository, automated builds and testing are triggered.
2. Build
3. Test
4. Deploy
