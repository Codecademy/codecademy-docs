The **CICD Pipeline** is the combination of continuous integration, delivery and deployment of software development and application deployment. The four main steps of the pipeline are: Source, Build, Test and Deploy. 

- **CI**: CI stands for Continuous Integration. This is the automation process for Developers.
- **CD**: The first CD stands for continuous delivery. This is the automated delivery of code to the testing and development steps of the pipeline. These environments are usually in a repository like [Github](https://www.github.com)
- **The other CD**: The second CD stands for continuous deployment. When code passes the automated tests, it is automatically placed in production, which is then used for automatic deployment.
