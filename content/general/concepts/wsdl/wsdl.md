**WSDL (Web Services Description Language)** is a specification for an [XML](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/xml) document that describes a web service. A WSDL document is a machine-readable description of how a service can be called, what parameters it expects, and what type of data structures are returned by it. [WSDL Version 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl/) was released by the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/standards/) (W3C) in 2007, but support for this version of the specification is still poorly implemented, with much web development software only supporting [WSDL Version 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/2001/NOTE-wsdl-20010315).
