Runtime can refer to either of the following two concepts:

- The period of time during which a program is running.
- A built-in application that supports the execution of a program.

The first definition is relatively general. The second definition is more specific to software development.

In software development, runtime commonly refers to the infrastructure required to implement features in the language itself. This can include functions for optimization, memory management, debugging, and input/output. Runtimes make software development easier for engineers by making these functions more accessible. These concepts are related to the second definition.

Runtime errors are common types of errors in software development. A runtime error is any error a program has while it is running.
