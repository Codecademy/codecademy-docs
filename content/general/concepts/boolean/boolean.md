Booleans hold a true or false value. Booleans are used in conditional statements. Ex:

## JavaScript Example

The following example uses [a JavaScript conditional statement](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/conditionals), along with a comparison [operator](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/operators) to return `true` or `false` if 42 is, in fact, "42":
```javascript
if (true) {
  // true would always evaluate to true so the folloing line will always run.
  console.log('this will always print');
} else if (false) {
  // false will alawys evaluate to false so the following lines will never run
  console.log('This will never print');
}
```
