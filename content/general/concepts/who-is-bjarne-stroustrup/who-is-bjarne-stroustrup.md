[Bjarne Stroustrup](https://www.stroustrup.com) is a Danish computer scientist and principle designer of C++, an extension of the C programming language.

Stroustrup has authored several computer programming books focused on C++, including *The C++ Programming Language*, and is currently a Visiting Professor in Computer Science at Columbia University.

As the principle designer of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup's goal for the language was "offering both hardware access and abstraction", and to do so efficiently. Stroustrup's continued work in maintaining C++ is associated with improvements in performance and efficiency for a great number of applications including AI/ML, RDBMS, video games, financial systems, and graphics.

Dr. Stroustrup played a key role in the development of Codecademy's [Learn C++](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus) course. 

Here's an interview called [Talking C++](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/bjarne-stroustrup-interview/) that we conducted during the end of the production.
