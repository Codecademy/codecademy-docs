UUID is a universally unique identifier. It can be generated on any computer without the use of a centralized authority. It's a string of 128 bits that is supposed to be unique with little to no chance of clashing with any other UUID produced by anybody else in the world.

UUIDs are usually used in database tables as unique keys.
They are useful any time we need an ID that needs to be unique in an application or system.

## UUID example in JavaScript

UUIDs can be used in JavaScript with the `uuid` package and installed via npm:

```
npm install uuid
```

This example shows how to generate a UUID with the `uuidv4()` function:

```js
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');

console.log(uuidv4());

// output: 7637c099-79c8-4685-ad47-b1b985f7ac2b
```
