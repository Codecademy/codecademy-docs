The **Spiral** model is a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) which is an excellent combination between Waterfall model and Iterative development. For each iteration, phases are repeatedly developed, with Risk Analysis and Prototype integrated.

The Spiral model was first introduced by Barry Boehm in 1986 as a result of applying iterative development in constructing softwares.

The workflow is divided in four phases:
- Planning
- Risk Analysis
- Engineering
- Evaluation

Each iteration consists of all above phases but has different aims which are usually:
- Prototype
- Release candidate
- Launch

## Advantages:
- Products are soon introduced with prototype.
- Errors and failures are identified and handled at ease.
- Frequent feedback and refinement through cycles.
- Flexible, adaptive to changes.

## Disadvantages:
- Complex workflow and required expertise especially in Risk Analysis.
- Costly and time-consuming.
