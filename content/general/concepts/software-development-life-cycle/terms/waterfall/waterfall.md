The **Waterfall** Model Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) aims to create a minimum viable product (MVP). Each phase in the SDLC must be completed before moving on to the next. It is suited to projects where features are easily defined from the start.

The Waterfall Model was the first SDLC methodology to be created and was first documented in 1970 by an American computer scientist called Dr. Winston W. Royce, though the term "Waterfall" wasn't used until later.

The diagram below shows how the workflow represents the natural flow of a waterfall, with the stages being completed in linear, sequential steps:

## Advantages

- Clear, defined structure.
- Easy to predict project timeline, budget, and scope.

## Disadvantages

- Difficult to make changes once the project has been started.
- Testing is delayed until development is completed, so errors aren't found until later.
