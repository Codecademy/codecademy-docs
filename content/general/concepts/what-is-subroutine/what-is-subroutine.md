Title: 'What is Subroutine?'
Description: 'Subroutine is a set of computer instructions written to perform a specific tasks.A subroutine is also known as a function or a procedure. Subroutine breaks code the code into smaller section which makes code more reusable and readable. Every programming languages has their own way of defining and calling subroutine or function.'

Subroutine is a set of computer instructions written to perform a specific task. A subroutine is also known as a function or a procedure. Subroutine breaks code the code into smaller section which makes code more reusable and readable.
## Syntax
Every programming languages has their own syntax of defining and calling subroutine or function. Let's take a look at pseudo codes for subroutines.

Pseudo code for declaraing subroutine:
```pseudo
declare <suboroutine_name>
    #subroutine code
end Subroutine
```
Pseudo code for calling subroutine :
```pseudo
call <subroutine_name>
```

In modern programming languages , we use functions which is simlar to subroutines it takes some arguments and may return some value after execution. Let's look at the syntax of C++.
```js
//declaraing function
function function_name(var1,var2,var3,...)
{
    // function body
    return return_value
    // return statement is optional
}

//calling function
function_name(var1,var2,var3,...)
```
For example :
```js
//declaraing
function sum(var1,var2){
    let return_value = var1+var2
    return return_value
}

//calling 
let total = sum(10,12)
console.log(total)
```
