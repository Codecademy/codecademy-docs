Ken Thompson is an American computer scientist, known for creating many significant works in the field, such as the Unix and Plan 9 operating systems, the B and Go programming languages, the `grep` command line utility, and UTF-8 encoding.

Ken Thompson is best known for working alongside Dennis Ritchie and others at Bell Laboratories, where they began working on Unix in 1967 as a replacement operating system for the Digital Equipment Corporation's PDP-7 mini computer.

During this time, Ken Thompson developed the B programming language, which would become the precursor for the incredibly popular and influential C programming language.
