Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that uses head-mounted headsets with displays to generate realistic images, sounds, and other sensations to put users into an immersive virtual environment. VR can create unbounded worlds that people can walk around and interact with using their hands, and to feel as if they were transported to another place.

It’s still considered the wild west of the tech industry⁠— fun, exciting, bustling of opportunities and things are looking very promising.

## Augmented Reality vs. Virtual Reality

Augmented reality utilizes the current physical setting of the user while introducing a layer of synthetic digital, sonic or somatic presentation to enhance the user experience.
Whereas, VR involves use of a headset to facilitate an experience rooted in the graphic and sonic presentation within the VR setup as opposed to using the individual's more broad physical surroundings for interaction.

Virtual reality is poised to grow substantially in use during the 21st century as it has many potential uses that range from entertainment, wellbeing, education, tourism, military, art and design etc.
