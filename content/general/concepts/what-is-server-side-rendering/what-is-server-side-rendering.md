Title: 'What is Server-Side Rendering?'
Description: 'Server-side rendering (SSR) is rendering the content on the server and presenting it to the client when a request is made. When a request is made in client-side rendering (opposite of server-side rendering), the server sends separate files and content that is rendered in the browser. JavaScript works both on the server and browser, so it is possible for developers to render the content of an application where they want. Why Server-Side Rendering is Important - Server-Side Rendering ensure fast load times for web pages. - Server-side rendering helps in improving SEO (Search Engine Optimization) by pre-rendering the page. - If the number of concurrent users increases, the load on the servers increases for a Server-Side Rendered website. This is where the server-side rendering approach is not useful.'

Server-side rendering is rendering the content on the server and presenting it to the client when the request is made. While in the client-side rendering (opposite of server-side rendering) when a request is made server sends separate files and the content is rendered in the browser. Javascript works both on server and browser, so it is possible for the developers to render the content of an application where they want.

## Why Server-side Rendering is Important

- When content is rendered on a server, the time required for downloading, parsing, and executing JavaScript code is reduced. This will ensure fast load times for web pages.

- Server-side rendering helps in improving SEO by pre-rendering the page. Thus search engine crawlers can easily read the generated HTML file. While in client-side rendering crawlers read an empty HTML file with links to javascript, which reduces the search ranking of the webpage. Fast loading of the server-side rendered webpage also helps the site to rank higher in search results.

- When the user clicks on a link for some content, the whole website is rendered again on the server. And if the number of concurrent users increases, the load on the servers increases. At scale, this can be troubling for SSR.
