A file path describes the location of a file in a computer's folder structure. They are used to locate files, like:

- Websites
- Images
- Videos
- Other programs

## Absolute File Paths

URL paths in HTML can be absolute paths, like a full URL, for example:

```pesudo
https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs
```

## Relative File Paths

Relative file path are paths that links to a local file in the same folder or on the same server, for example:

- **./about.html**
- **./js/script.js**

Relative file paths begin with `./` followed by a path to the local file. `./` tells the browser to look for the file path from the current folder.
