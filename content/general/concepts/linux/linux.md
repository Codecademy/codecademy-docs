**Linux** refers to a class of [open source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/open-source), [Unix](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/unix)-like operating systems that are all based on the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel was developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/linus-torvalds) and first released on September 17, 1991.

Since its release, the Linux kernel has been adopted by many operating system distributions (commonly called "distros") for a wide variety of applications, from web-servers to mobile platforms. The most well known pure Linux distro is Ubuntu, but other well-known operating systems, such as Android and Chrome OS are based on the Linux kernel though with modifications that place them outside most Linux distros.
