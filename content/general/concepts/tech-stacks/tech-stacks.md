## Tech Stacks

A technology stack is a set of technologies stacked together to build any application. Technology stacks are commonly referred to as technology infrastructures or solutions stacks, which are essential for building easy-to-maintain, scalable web applications.

A tech stack refers to tools, programming languages, and technologies that work together to build digital products or solutions such as websites, mobile, and web apps.

### Frontend Tech Stack
The front end is the part of a software program that a user interacts with. One of the primary goals of front-end development is to create a smooth or frictionless user experience. Basically, the user interface of an application or website should be simple and straightforward.

There are three major elements that make up the frontend stack. These are

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is the standard markup language for building Web pages. It is also the building block of the web and is used to structure a web page and its content.

- CSS (Cascading style sheets): CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document. It describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

- Javascript: JavaScript is the programming language of the Web. It is used to make web pages interactive and it allows the implementation of dynamic web pages. Some of the popular javascript frameworks include React, Vue, Angular and svelte.

### Backend Tech Stack
The back end also known as the server-side refers to parts of a computer application or a program's code that allow it to operate and that cannot be accessed by a user. The back end of a computer system is where the majority of data and operating syntax are kept and accessible.

The backend tech stack comprises the following elements:
  Programming Languages: A programming language is a computer language programmers use to develop software programs or other sets of instructions for computers to execute. Examples include Javascript, Python, Java, etc.

- Frameworks: A framework is a tool that provides ready-made components or solutions that are customized in order to speed up development. Popular frameworks used in development include Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Express, and Django.

- Databases: A database is a systematic collection of structured information or data. The most common databases include MongoDB, Postgresql, MySQL, and SQL.

- Servers: A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client. It responds and accepts to requests made over a network. Commonly used servers are AWS, Google Cloud, Apache, Nginx, Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS), etc.


### LAMP Stack
The LAMP stack is a popular open-source tech stack that is used to create web apps. It is one of the oldest tech stacks. The LAMP stack provides a collection of software for delivering high-performance web applications. This stack comprises the following technologies

- L — Linux: An open-source operating system based on the Linux kernel
- A — Apache: A free and open-source cross-platform web server.
- M — MySQL: A relational database management system for storing and manipulating data.
- P — PHP: A server-side scripting programming language used for creating dynamic web applications.

### MERN Stack
MERN is used to describe a specific set of JavaScript-based technologies that are used in the web application development process. It is made of technologies such as MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. The MERN stack is one of the most popular technology stacks.

- M – MongoDB: MongoDB is a document database used to build highly available and scalable internet applications.
- E – Express(.js): A backend framework built on Nodejs and it provides features for developing mobile and web applications.
- R — React(.js):  A frontend javascript library developed by Meta for building user interface.
- N — Node(.js): A javaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine.

### MEVN stack
The MEVN stack is a JavaScript software stack that is open-source and has emerged as a cutting-edge method for creating robust and dynamic web applications.  Its software components can be utilized to efficiently design frontend and backend development while also improving the operation of your website or app.

- M – MongoDB: MongoDB is a document database used to build highly available and scalable internet applications.
- E – Express(.js): A backend framework built on Nodejs and it provides features for developing mobile and web applications.
- V — Vue(.js):  A frontend Javascript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
- N — Node(.js):  A javaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine.
  
### MEAN Stack

The Mean stack is a collection of javascript-based technologies in the development of web apps. The mean stack is used to create full-stack applications. This means that javascript is used across the entire system, from the frontend to the backend to the server and finally to the database. MEAN stands for MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.


- M – MongoDB: MongoDB is a document database used to build highly available and scalable internet applications.
- E – Express(.js):  A backend framework built on Nodejs and it provides features for developing mobile and web applications.
- A — Angular(.js): A frontend javascript framework created by Google for building single-page client applications 
- N — Node(.js):  A JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine.

### Ruby on Rails
Ruby on Rails also called Rails is a free and open-source framework that is built in Ruby and is used for developing web applications. On both the front end and the back end, it supports all the tools you'll need to build amazing web apps.

Using the Rails framework, you may build a web application that runs on a web server by combining the Ruby programming language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### ASP .Net

ASP .NET is an open-source, server-side web-application framework created by Microsoft for building web pages. The platform allows programmers to develop dynamic websites, applications, and services. ASPNET is short for  Active Server Pages Network Enabled Technologies. Among its features are enterprise-level applications, mobile applications, and web applications. This stack comprises the following technologies:
- ASP.NET MVC
- IIS
- Microsoft Azure
- SQL Server
- NET core

### JAMstack
JAMstack is a new trend in web development. It is a term that describes a modern web development architecture based on JavaScript, APIs, and Markup (JAM). The Jamstack stack is not a specific technology or framework, but rather a different architecture for developing apps and websites.
