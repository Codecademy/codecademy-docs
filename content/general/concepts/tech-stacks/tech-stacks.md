A **technology (or "tech") stack** refers to a set of softwares that work together to build digital products or solutions such as websites and mobile applications. Essential for building maintainable and scalable software, tech stacks are also referred to as technology infrastructures or solution stacks.

### Front-End Tech Stack

The [front-end](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/front-end) is the part of a software program that a user interacts with. The [UI/UX design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux) of an application or website should be seamless and straightforward, which is why it is a primary goal of front-end development.

The three major elements that make up the front-end stack are [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html), [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css), and [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript).

### Back-End Tech Stack
The[ back-end](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/back-end), or server-side, refers to parts of an application's code that allow it to operate and handle new and existing data. This cannot usually be accessed by a user. The back-end of a computer system is where the majority of data and operating syntax are stored and accessed.

The back-end tech stack is usually comprised of programming languages, [frameworks](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/framework), [databases](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/database), and [servers](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/server).

## Common Stacks

### LAMP Stack

The LAMP stack is a popular open-source tech stack that is used to create web apps. It is one of the oldest tech stacks and provides a collection of software for delivering high-performance web applications. This stack comprises the following technologies:

- Linux: An open-source operating system based on the Linux kernel
- Apache: A free and open-source cross-platform web server.
- MySQL: A relational database management system for storing and manipulating data.
- PHP: A server-side scripting programming language used for creating dynamic web applications.

### MERN And Alternative Stacks

MERN is used to describe a specific set of JavaScript-based technologies that are used in the web application development process. It is made of technologies such as MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. The MERN stack is one of the most popular technology stacks. Alternative stacks are the MEVN and MEAN stack. The only difference is Vue.js or Angular.js is used in place of React.js as the front-end framework.

- MongoDB: MongoDB is a document database used to build highly available and scalable internet applications.
- Express(.js): A backend framework built on Node.js and it provides features for developing mobile and web applications.
- [React(.js)](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react) / Vue.js / Angular.js
- Node(.js) is a runtime environment that runs JavaScript on the server-side.
