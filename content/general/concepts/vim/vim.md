[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a text editor that is free, [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/open-source), and based on the `vi` editor that was originally created for the Unix operating system. However, it can be run on other systems such as Windows, Mac, Linux, or Android.
