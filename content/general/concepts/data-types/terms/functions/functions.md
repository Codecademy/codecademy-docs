# Functions

Depending on the language, functions can be utilized as variables and arguments for other functions.

```javascript

function someFunction() {
  return "Hello World!"
 } // nothing happends
 
 somefunction() // outputs Hello World! because the function was called
 
 function otherFunction(name) {
  return `Hi ${name} welcome to Codecademy docs!`
 } // nothing happends
 
 otherFunction("Codecademy") // outputs Hi Codecademy welcome to Codecademy docs! because the function was called and we use the Codecademy as the agument.
 ```
