Data is the foundation of all programs. In programming, data is classified into data types to let the compiler know how the data is being used. 

Data types can be simple or complex. Simple data types are the most basic types and usually hold a single value.  A complex data type can be composed of multiple data types and often group multiple values.


Some simple data types are:


| Data Type   | Description                                                                                                               |

| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Numbers` | Numbers include `-1`, `0`, `1`, and so on. (Depending on the language decimals are a different data type.)                                         |

| `String` | Strings is just text. Either single quotes (`''`) or double quotes (`""`) can be used.  For example: `"Codecademy is awesome! üñ•Ô∏è‚å®Ô∏è"`                      |

| `Boolean` | Booleans are a `true` for `false` value. Ex: `codeingIsFun = true`                                                                              |
| `null` | `null` repersents no value.                                                                                                                        |
| `Undefined` | `Undefined` also represents no value.                                                                                                         |


Some complex data types are:


| Data Type   | Description                                                                                                                |

| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Arrays | Arrays (called lists in some languages) are lists the compiler can read. Values can be found using the index. The index starts at 0. Ex: `randomThings = ["javascript, true, 5, null, [1, 2, 3]]` `javascript` is at index 0, `true` is at index 1, and so on.  `randomThings[2]`  will access the third item which has the value of `5`. Arrays can be within arrays, a value of a nested array can be accessed like this: `randomThings[4][1]`, this has the value of `2`.                                                   |

| Objects | Objects are is a group of related data.                                                                                                           |
| Classes | Classes are templates for objects
