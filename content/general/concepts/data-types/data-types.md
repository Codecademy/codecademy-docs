Data is foundational in programming and is classified into different types to indicate how it can be interpreted and used in the compiler. While there are certainly other kinds, data types are mostly categorized as either being primitive or composite in value.

## Primitive Data Types

In computer programming, primitive data types are the building blocks for any variable or data structure in a program. They usually contain a single value such as a character, byte, or digit. Below are a few examples of primitive types:

| Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Number](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/number) | Includes `-1`, `0`, `1`, and so on. Depending on the language, numbers with decimals are of a different type. |
| [String](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/string) | Sequences of characters surrounded by single quotes (''), double quotes (""), and/or backticks (` `` `), depending on the language. For example: `"Codecademy is awesome! üñ•Ô∏è‚å®Ô∏è"` |
| [Boolean](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/boolean) | Holds a logical value of `true` or `false`. |

## Composite Data Types

While primitive types are the building blocks, composite data types are the building. They are composed of multiple primitive data types, sometimes referred to as members, elements, or items. These items can all be of one uniform data type or be a mix of different ones. The follow are examples of well known composite types:

| Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/array) | Collections of values that are accessed at a specific numbered index, which usually start at 0, then 1, and so on. Nested arrays (arrays within arrays) are also possible. Referred to as lists in some languages. |
| [Object](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/object) | Groups of related data that are usually organized as property-value pairs. |
| [Class](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/class) | Templates for objects that may contain properties or methods. |

## Other Common Data Types

Data types have gone beyond just composites and primitives and include ones with unique qualities such as the following:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Null | `null` or `nil` represents the absence of a value. |
| Undefined | Represents a value that has not yet been defined. |
| [Function](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/function) | Depending on the language, functions can be utilized as variables and arguments for other functions. |
| Void | Sets a function to have side effects but return no specific result. Common in C-based languages. |
| Complex Number | Type representation for complex numbers, sometimes with `i` or `complex`. |

## Data Types in Different Languages

The way that data types look and work may vary from one programming language to another:

- [JavaScript data types](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/data-types)
- [Java data types](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/data-types)
- [Python data types](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/data-types)
- [R data types](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/r/data-types)
