Data is the foundation of all programs. In programing there are 5 simple data types and 3 complex data types. 

The simple data types are:

| Data Type   | Description  of said data type                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Numbers` | Numbers include `-1`, `0`, `1` and so on. (Depending on the languge deciamls are a diffrent data type.)                                         |
| `String` | Strings is just text. You can use single quotes (`''`) or double quotes (`""`) For example: `"Codecademy is awsome! üñ•Ô∏è‚å®Ô∏è"`                      |
| `Boolean` | Booleans are a `true` for `false` value. Ex: `codeingIsFun = true`                                                                              |
| `null` | `null` repersents no value.                                                                                                                        |
| `Undefined` | `Undefined` also repersents no value.                                                                                                         |

The complex data types are:

| Data Type   | Description  of said data type                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Arrays | Arrays (called lists in some languges) are a list that a computer can easly read. You can find a value using the index. The index starts at 0. Ex: `randomThings = ["javascript, true, 5, null, [1, 2, 3]]` Javscript index is 0, true is 1 and so on. You can acsess values like this: `randomThings[2]` and that has the value of 5. You can have arrays with in arrays you can acsess the value like this: `randomThings[4][1]` and that has the value of 2.                                                   |
| Objects | Objects are is a group of related data.                                                                                                           |
| Classes | Classes are templates for objects
