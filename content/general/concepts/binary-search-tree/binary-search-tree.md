A **binary search tree** is a data structure that is comprised of nodes in a branching relationship, each node having a key signifying its value. Each node can have zero, one, or two child nodes branching off from it. The tree has one root node that has no parent.

All nodes in the left branch of a parent node have values that are less than the parent node's value, and all nodes in the right branch of a parent node have values that are greater than the parent node's value.

Below is a diagram of a binary search tree.

The part of the tree with nodes `1`,`2` & `3` is referred to as the left subtree, and the part with nodes `5`,`6` & `7` is referred to as the right subtree. Both subtrees are themselves binary search trees. The nodes `1`,`3`,`5` & `7` are referred to as leaf nodes, because they have no children.
