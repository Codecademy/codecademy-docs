Numbers include `-1`, `0`, `1`, and so on. Depending on the language, numbers with decimals are of a different type. When computing numbers such they trade-off accuracy for range. Witch means they trade-off how acute it is with how many numbers it can compute.

## Arithmetic Accuracy 

Languages such as Javascript and Python yield interesting results when arithmetic operations are performed on numeric values. For example, `.1+.2` would evaluate tol `0.30000000000000004`, whereas adding whole numbers wouldn't do this. But you need to keep in mind the integer limit. It is the number where the compiler won't understand the numbers anymore.
