Numbers include `-1`, `0`, `1`, and so on. Depending on the language, numbers with decimals are of a different type. When computing numbers such they trade-off accuracy for range. Witch means they trade-off how acute it is with how many numbers it can compute. Languages such as Javascript and Python do this. This is why when you do this `.1+.2` it would equal `0.30000000000000004`. But if you are adding whole numbers it works all the time. But you need to keep in mind the integer limit. It is the number where the compiler won't understand the numbers anymore.
