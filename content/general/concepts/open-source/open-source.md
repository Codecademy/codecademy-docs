"Open source" refers to software that is released with the source code made freely available for modification and possible redistribution. Open source projects allow the code to be reused by anyone with the restriction that any derivative projects are released under the same license.
Such projects are intended to foster open collaboration, with many developers reviewing and updating the code. One benefit of this is that it provides greater opportunity for bugs and security holes to be detected and fixed. Open source software is also thought to be more trustworthy, since all the code is available to the public, any unwanted or nefarious code will be quickly exposed by the development community surrounding the project.

One of the most famous open source projects is the Linux operating system. Ever since the Linux kernel was released in 1991, an endless variety of Linux distributions have been released, all similarly open source. Typically, the most popular software for the Linux operating system are open source as well.
Another popular open source project is LibreOffice, a competitor to Microsoft Office, that offers word processing, spreadsheet, presentation and database software.
Another common open source product is MySQL, which is commonly used as a back-end database on many websites.
