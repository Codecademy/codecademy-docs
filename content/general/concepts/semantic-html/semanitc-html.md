**Semantic HTML** is the use of HTML tags that are representative of the content, so that browsers can appropriately parse the content of a site. This is beneficial as it ensures that content can be described accurately for those that rely on accessibility features.

Tags such as a `<div>` or `<span>` represent non-semantic HTML: these tags do not convey any information about their content. These tags are multipurpose containers that can support a variety of content. The use of these tags obscures the contents of a page and does not capitalize on the inbuilt attributes available in the use of the appropriate semantic tags.

Semantic tags are those that are designated for a specific purpose such as `<header>` or `<figure>`, which is communicated by the tag name. In addition to providing better clarity to the organization and content of a page semantic tags enable additional features for accessibility. For example, the use of the `<button>` tag for controlling any embedded media also allows for navigation, and use of the button via keyboard.
