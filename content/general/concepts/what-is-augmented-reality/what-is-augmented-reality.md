Augmented Reality(AR) is a digitally enhanced real world experience provided through hardware. In many instances AR provides an additional sensory experience to natural settings. A popular example of Augmented Reality in application is the video game 'Pokemon Go'. 

An augogram is the computer generated image that is used to create an Augmented Reality experience. The term for this science and software practice is called augography.

## What is the difference between Augmented Reality vs. Virtual Reality 

The difference between Augemented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality is that Augmented Reality utilizes the current physical setting of the user while introducing a layer of synthetic digital,sonic or somatic presentation to enhance the user experience wherelse Virtual Reality (VR) involves use of a headset to facilitate an experience rooted in the graphic and sonic presentation within the VR setup as opposed to using the individuals more broad physical surroundings for interaction.

Augmented Reality is poised to grow substantially in use during the 21st century as it has many potential uses that range from entertainment, medical, commercial, military, fashion and design etc.

##  Examples of Augmented Reality use

* Viewing merchandise/goods without trying them on at retail stores and shopping platforms Ikea, Neiman Marcus etc.

* Flight/Combat simulation Military, Commercial Aviation 

* Physical Markers for direction and navigation 

* Commercial and Residential Design and Architecture - viewing an architects work in real time at a location

* Training for Medical Procedures - nurse, doctor training.
