**Geolocation** refers to the process of determining the geographic location of an object, typically through electronic means such as GPS. The most common example of geolocation currently is the location function in various electronic devices such as smartphones.

Many modern applications can be given access to a device's geolocation data, so a review app can show restaurants within a few miles/kilometers, a banking app can show nearby branches, or a game can offer [augmented reality](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/augmented-reality) experiences based on where the device is located.
Also, most smartphones have a mapping app that can locate the phone on a street map in order to provide directions to some other location.

## Common Types of Geolocation

There are three main ways a smartphone (and other consumer electronic device) can provide geolocation services:

- The Global Positioning System (GPS): A device can have a GPS receiver that communicates with the GPS satellite system that uses the positions of the satellites it can communicate with to determine its position on the ground. A disadvantage is that things like heavy tree cover or buildings can interfere with the signal.
- Wireless: A device connects with several different cell towers in the area and using signal strength and [triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation) determines its position on the ground. The disadvantage is this can be inaccurate when there are limited cell towers available, and will not work where there is no cell reception.
- Wireless-assisted GPS: Combines both methods to compensate for the weaknesses of both. It can often get the device's location faster than GPS alone.
