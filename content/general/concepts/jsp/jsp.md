**JSP** (Jakarta Server Pages, formerly JavaServer Pages) is a technology that allows a web developer to mix [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html) with [Java](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java) code that is executed on the web server to render the final web page. In this way it is similar to [PHP](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/php) except that it uses the Java programming language. With JSP the developer can create dynamic pages based on HTML, XML, SOAP or other document types.

JSP was released in 1999 by Sun Microsystems, and version 3.1 was released on April 31, 2022.
