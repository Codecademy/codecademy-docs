**JSP** (Jakarta Server Pages, formerly JavaServer Pages) is a technology that allows a web developer to mix textual content with [Java](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java) code that is executed on the web server to render the final web page. In this way it is similar to [PHP](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/php) except that it uses the Java programming language. With JSP the developer can create dynamic pages based on [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html), [XML](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/xml), SOAP or other document types.

JSP was released in 1999 by Sun Microsystems, and version 3.1 was released on April 31, 2022.

## Advantages

JSP has the following advantages compared to other methods of creating dynamic web pages.

- The execution of JSP pages is faster than other technologies.
- JSP pages are compiled before being processed by the server, reducing the load on the server.
- JSP has access to all the Java APIs.
- Since JSP uses the Java Virtual Machine, JSP is platform-agnostic and portable.
