A **hash table** is a data structure that stores an arbitrary number of items, mapping keys to values, and uses a hash function to compute an index. The hash table relates the hashed keys to an array of buckets where the associated value can be found. When looking up a value, the provided key is hashed and the resulting hash is used to retreve the corrisponding value.
