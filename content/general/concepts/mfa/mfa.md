**Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)** is the use of more than one factor to prove one's identity.

## Factors

One factor is typically a username or email and password combination. This is the basic log-in functionality that most websites require user's to create when initially signing up for an account.

Other factors, depending on the verification system, can be a physical item, pin, key or token, biometric marker, or location.

## Examples

ATMs often require a physical card and a memorized pin to successfully take out cash.

A secure sites, like GitHub, allow users to enable MFA through a pin that's sent to a physical device like a mobile phone. This is very secure because in order to be verified, a person would need the physical device which probably has a pin and biometric marker factor.

More factors in the verification process results in greater security.
