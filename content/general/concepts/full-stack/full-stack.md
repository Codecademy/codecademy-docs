**Full-stack** development refers to having competency in both client and server-side software to build entire applications from the [back-end](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/software-stack/back-end), through [APIs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/api), to the [front-end](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/software-stack/front-end). Full-stack developers are able to handle both front-end and back-end tasks. Typically, full-stack developers are stronger in either front or back-end and throughout their careers, gain competence in the full-stack.

## Hiring Trends

Larger companies have the resources to hire large development teams, which allows them to have teams where developers can specialize in either front-end or back-end.

Startups, on the other hand, may be limited in their ability to hire a large development team, so instead will seek full-stack developers. They tend to seek full-stack developers for several reasons, one of which is funding.

## Common Tasks

Full-stack web development can involve a variety of front-end and back-end tasks, including:

- Creating and updating webpages.
- Making sure webpages are responsive and work well on phones or tablets.
- Improving website performance.
- Adding and improving accessibility features.
- Using front-end [frameworks](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/framework) to build client-side software.
- Building and consuming APIs.
- Creating, integrating, and managing [databases](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/database).
- Using back-end frameworks to build server-side software.
- Validating data to make sure it's formatted correctly before being sent to the database.
- Integrating user-facing elements with server-side elements to make sure that information is being sent to the right place so the server can retrieve it.
