**Yukihiro Matsumoto** (1965-present) a.k.a one of the open source evangelists of Japan, is a Japanese Software Programmer and Computer Scientist widely known for his work as the chief designer of Ruby. Matz blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form [Ruby](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby), a language of careful balance. Apart from Ruby, he is known for having released several open source products, including cmail, the emacs-based mail user agent, written entirely in emacs lisp.

As of 2011, Matz is the Chief Architect of Ruby at [Heroku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroku "Heroku"), an online cloud platform-as-a-service  in San Francisco. Down the line, he was appointed to the role of technical advisor for VASILY Inc. starting in June 2014.

## Writing

In 2001, Matz published a book called _Ruby in a Nutshell_, and _The Ruby Programming Language_ book published in 2008. His demeanor has brought about a motto in the Ruby community: _"Matz is nice and so we are nice,"_ commonly abbreviated as MINASWAN.
