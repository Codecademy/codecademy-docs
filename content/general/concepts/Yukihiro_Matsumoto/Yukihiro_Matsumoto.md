**Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto** (1965-present) is a software programmer and computer scientist widely known for his work as the chief designer of the [Ruby](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby) programming language. Blending parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp), Matz formed Ruby into "a language of careful balance." As one of Japan's [open source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source) evangelists, he has released products like [mruby](https://github.com/mruby/mruby) (a lightweight version of Ruby).

Matz's demeanor has inspired the Ruby community motto "Matz is nice and so we are nice," commonly abbreviated as MINASWAN.

## Recent Activity

As of 2011, Matz is the Chief Architect of Ruby at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), an online cloud platform-as-a-service. Starting in June 2014, he was appointed to the role of Technical Advisor for VASILY Inc.

## Writing

In 2001, Matz published a book called "Ruby in a Nutshell." This was later expanded and revised into a new book called "The Ruby Programming Language," released in 2008 and co-authored by David Flanagan.
