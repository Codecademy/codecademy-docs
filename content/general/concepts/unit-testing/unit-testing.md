Unit testing is an important part of coding and software development because it verifies whether individual parts of the source code behave and work as expected.

A part or unit of code can be anything from a class function to a small snippet of code that performs a specific task. Testing individual components makes it easier to find exactly where an error lies.

## Types of Unit Testing

Unit testing is usually categorized into two types:

- Manual testing
- Automated testing

### Manual Testing

Manual testing is when tests are done directly by testers. This can involve actions such as clicking on objects, providing input, or scrolling through items.

Depending on the length of the software, this type of testing can be time-consuming. An alternative to unit testing would be automated testing.

### Automated Testing

Automated testing is when programs are written specifically to test code. This is optimal when manual testing becomes tedious, frequent testing is needed, or when multiple individuals are adding or making changes to the code.

Writing scripts to test parts of the source code is a way to automate testing. Combined with a testing automation tool, these scripts can run automatically and immediately inform developers if any errors have occurred.

## Why use Unit Testing?

Unit testing is an important part of the development phase when writing code. It's best practice to test parts or units of code to verify its correctness during development or after making changes. A unit of code can be anything from a class function to a snippet of code and testing can be done manually or through automation.
