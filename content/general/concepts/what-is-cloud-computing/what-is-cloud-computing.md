Cloud computing is the distribution of technology services over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing, such as databases, computation power, software, artificial intelligience/machine learning tools and many more.

## History of Cloud Computing

Amazon launched Amazon Web Services (AWS) internally as a way to offer its developers with the database and computing capabilities they needed in the early 2000s. Developers were able to use their computer's capacity far more efficiently thanks to the Cloud Computing Infrastructure Model. Other tech behemoths like Google and Microsoft then realised and rapidly followed suit by developing their own cloud services. After that, cloud computing exploded in popularity during the course of the year, and it's expected to continue to do so.

## Why adopt Cloud Computing?

Developers can accomplish so much more with cloud computing. Here are some of the advantages that cloud adoption can provide for developers.

### Scalability

Scalability reduces the risks of internal operational problems and maintenance.Developers can scale up or down as needed. They might, for example, have more powerful servers if their app's popularity and traffic grew.

### Cost

Cloud computing offers flexible payment with pay-as-you-go pricing. Businesses only need to pay when they used them. In addition, businesses save money on hardware purchases, building and managing on-site data center.

### Performance

Cloud computing providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform upgrade to the latest generation of computing hardware and software on a regular basis. With this in mind, businesses and organisations do not need to be concerned about when to upgrade their on-site data center and computing technology.

## How Cloud Computing works under the hood?

As an example, consider an ecommerce site. Users can use the site to place orders for the items they require. What there is a Black Friday Sale? Although, more users means more traffic to the site, which is a good thing.

There's a high chance that the site will crash. Backend services may be unable to meet user demand which might slow down the site and causing users to abandon the site.

This is when cloud enters the picture. When businesses require more computing power, the cloud can provide it immediately. Businesses scale up and down in response to increased user traffic. When compared to on-site premise, it is far faster to set up.

## Who is using Cloud Computing?

A wide spectrum of enterprises have move to the cloud. Some big names include Netflix, Xerox, Instagram, Apple and more.
