A **technology (or "tech") stack** refers to a set of software that work together to build digital products or solutions such as websites and mobile applications. Essential for building maintainable and scalable software, tech stacks are also known as technology infrastructures or solution stacks.

### Front-End Tech Stack

The [front-end](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/software-stack/front-end) is the part of an application the user interacts with. The [UI/UX design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux) of an application or website should be seamless and straightforward, which is why it is a primary goal of front-end development.

The three major elements that make up the front-end stack are [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html), [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css), and [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript).

### Back-End Tech Stack

The [back-end](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/software-stack/back-end), or server-side, refers to parts of an application's code that allow it to operate and handle new and existing data.It is inaccessible to the user. The back-end of an application is where the data and operating syntax are stored and accessed.

The back-end tech stack is comprised of programming languages, [frameworks](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/framework), [databases](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/database), and [servers](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/software-stack/server).

## Common Stacks

Below are some common stacks used to develop fullstack applications.

### LAMP Stack

The LAMP stack is a popular back-end tech stack used to create web apps. It is one of the oldest tech stacks and provides a collection of software for delivering high-performance web applications. This stack contains the following technologies:

- [Linux](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/linux): An open-source operating system based on the Linux kernel.
- Apache: A free and open-source cross-platform web server.
- MySQL: A relational database management system for storing and manipulating data on the back-end.
- [PHP](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/php): A server-side scripting programming language used for creating dynamic web applications.

### MEXN Stack

This well-known tech stack comes in a few forms but all of them use:

- [MongoDB](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-mongodb) for the databse. It is a document database used to build highly available and scalable internet applications.
- [Express.js](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/express) for the back-end. It is a back-end framework built on Node.js and it provides features for developing mobile and web applications.
- [Node.js](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/node-js) for the server. It is a runtime environment that runs JavaScript on the server-side.

One of the following front-end frameworks, for building user interfaces and single-page applications, is commonly used in this stack:

- [React.js](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react) (ME**R**N)
- [Angular](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/angular) (ME**A**N
- [Vue](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-vue-js) (ME**V**N)

### Django Stack

Highlights for this stack include the use of [Django](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-python-web-apps-with-django), a popular [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python) framework that is structured around creating templates. This can be used with a front-end framework like Vue for building a web application.
