Modulo is a mathematical operation available in every programming language along with more common ones like addition and multiplication. A modulo operation takes two arguments and returns the remainder of the first argument divided by the second. The result of the operation is called the modulus.

Most programming languages use the symbol `%` to represent the modulo operation, though some may use `mod` or other variations.

## Examples

The following is an example of the modulo operator in Python:

```python
modulus = 14 % 5
print(f"14 % 5 results in a modulus of {modulus}")
# Output : 14 % 5 results in a modulus of 4

modulus = 37 % 3
print(f"37 % 3 Results in a modulus of {modulus}")
# Output: 37 % 3 Results in a modulus of 1

modulus = 21 % 7
print(f"21 % 7 results in a modulus of {modulus}")
# Output: 21 % 7 results in a modulus of 0
```
