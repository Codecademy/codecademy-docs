Aaron Swartz was an American programmer, writer, entrepreneur, and internet activist. He was involved in the development of the RSS web feed format, Markdown language, Creative Commons organization, and Python web framework web.py. 

# Entrepreneurship

Aaron Swartz was a co-founder of a startup called Infogami, which later became the social news site Reddit. He was given the title of a co-founder of Reddit by Paul Graham of Y Combinator.

## Activism

In later years, he led the charge fighting the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) through his activist
organization, DemandProgress.

He published an essay called *Guerilla Open Access Manifesto* in 2008:

> With enough of us, around the world, we’ll not just send a strong message opposing the privatization of knowledge — we’ll make it a thing of the past. Will you join us?

## United States vs Aaron Swartz

In 2011, Swartz was arrested by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) police on state breaking-and-entering charges, after connecting a computer to the MIT network in an unmarked and unlocked closet, and setting it to download academic journal articles systematically.

Federal prosecutors, led by Carmen Ortiz, later charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in prison, asset forfeiture, restitution, and supervised release.

Swartz declined a plea bargain under which he would have served six months in federal prison. Two days after the prosecution rejected a counter-offer by Swartz, he was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment, where he committed suicide. He was 26 years old.

R.I.P. Aaron.
