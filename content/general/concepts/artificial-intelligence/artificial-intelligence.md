**Artificial-Intelligence (AI)** is the simulation of human intelligence in computer systems. AI technology can perform learning, reasoning, and problem solving tasks to enable solutions to a variety of complex problems. AI systems can be simple algorithms that perform specific tasks, like a making suggestions of products to buy according to product purchase history, to complex algorithms that can power self-driving cars that can take passengers from one place to another by planning routes and avoiding obstacles without human intervention. The demand for AI powered solutions is growing at a rapid rate and intersecting into almost every aspect of our daily life.

## Types of Artificial-Intelligence 

- **Reactive Machines AI**
  - These are the most basic types of AI systems. They do not have memory or use past data to inform new decisions or factor them into solutions. They react to specific inputs with specific outputs.
- **Limited Memory AI**
  - These AI systems can use memory and stored data to make future decisions and outputs. However, they have only temporary memory that is only stored for a brief time.
- **Theory of Mind AI**
  - These are advanced AI systems that involve machines that emotions, behavior, and interactions to a human like quality. This allows for AI systems to understand and interact with humans.
- **Self-Aware AI**
  - This would be the most advanced type of AI system and is currently hypothetical. In this type of system, a machine would have a defined consciousness and be self-aware. It would be able to make decisions, feel emotions, and act on them based on its own intentions and desires.


## Artificial Intelligence Applications 
Artificial-Intelligence in the field of computer science and programming has specific areas of application. The most popular ones the following:

- **Business**: AI is playing an increasingly important role in businesses. AI-powered tools can help businesses collect, analyze, and visualize data more efficiently and effectively. This can lead to improved decision-making, increased productivity, and reduced costs.
- **Healthcare**: AI plays an increasingly important role in healthcare. AI-powered tools can help doctors diagnose diseases, develop new treatments, and provide personalized care to patients.
- **Education**: AI could be used in education to personalize learning, improve student engagement, and automate administrative tasks for schools and other organizations.    
- **Finance**: AI can help financial services institutions in five general areas: personalize services and products, create opportunities, manage risk and fraud, enable transparency and compliance, and automate operations and cost reduction.
- **Manufacturing**: Some ways that AI may be used in manufacturing including automating tasks, such as assembly and inspection, optimizing production processes
and can be used to detect defects and improve quality control.
