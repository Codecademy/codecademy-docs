**Artificial-Intelligence (AI)** is the simulation of human intelligence in computer systems. AI technology can perform learning, reasoning, and problem solving tasks to enable solutions to a variety of complex problems. AI systems can be simple algorithms that perform specific tasks, like a making suggestions of products to buy according to product purchase history, to complex algorithms that can power self-driving cars that can take passengers from one place to another by planning routes and avoiding obstacles without human intervention. The demand for AI powered solutions is growing at a rapid rate and intersecting into almost every aspect of our daily life.

## Types of Artificial-Intelligence 

- Reactive Machines
  - These are the most basic type of AI systems that do not have memory or used past data to inform new decision or factor them into solutions. They react to specific inputs with specific outputs.
- Limited Memory
  - These AI systems can used memory and stored data to make future decisions and outputs. They have only temporary memory that are only stored for a brief time.
- Theory of Mind
  - These are advanced AI systems that involve machines that emotions, behavior, and interactions to a human like quality. This allows for AI systems to understand and interact with humans. 
- Self-Aware AI
  - This would be the most advanced type of AI system and is currently hypothetical. This is where a machine would have a defined consciousness and be self-aware. They can make decision, feel emotions, and act on them based on their own intentions and desires.


## Artificial Intelligence Applications 
Artificial-Intelligence in the field of computer science and programming has specific areas of application. The most popular ones the following:

- **Natural Language Processing**: Language Translation, AI Chatbots, 
- **Computer Vision**: Facial Recognition, Autonomous vehicles, Surveillance
- **Machine Learning**: Image and Speech recognition, Recommendation systems, fraud detection   
- **Robotics**: Manufacturing automation, service robots
