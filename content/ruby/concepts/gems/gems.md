In Ruby, gems are open-source Ruby libraries or applications that lend extra utilities to other applications. Each gem is composed of: 

* Source code (including tests)
* Documentation (with metadata including name, version and platform)
* A `gemspec` file holding all Gem-related metadata.

There is a registry of gems on [Rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/) for reference, download and publishing of individual gems. 

To install gems to the local machine: 

```
gem install [gem-name]
```

To display a list of previously installed gems: 

```
gem list
```

Some popular gems include: 

* [Active Record](https://rubygems.org/gems/activerecord/versions/5.0.0.1) for object-relational database management in Ruby on Rails
* [Pry](https://rubygems.org/gems/pry) for runtime, REPL-style inspection of programs
* [OmniAuth](https://rubygems.org/gems/omniauth) for third-party authentication
* [Sinatra](https://rubygems.org/gems/sinatra) for a minimal, light web framework
* [Rails](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails) for a heavy-lifting, full-stack framework
