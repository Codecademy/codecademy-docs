In Git, the `reset` command is used to change the state of the Git repository or undo commits.

## Syntax

```
git reset <mode-option> <commit>
```

The mode refers to the options for the reset command. These include:
1. --soft: This undoes the commit but still shows the file as staged and permits only new commits.
2. --mixed: This undoes the commit and unstages the file and the file can be edited and committed normally.
3. --hard: This removes the new commit including all changes and uncommitted files.

The commit can either be the commit hash generated by Git, or in reference to the HEAD.

## Example

Suppose a file named **example.md** is accidentally committed to a Git repository. To undo the commit, the command `git reset --mixed HEAD~1` is used in the terminal. `--mixed` is the default mode, so `git reset HEAD~1` will achieve the same result. This resets the HEAD and index to the previous commit.

**Note:** HEAD refers to the current commit while index refers to the staging area where files are [added using Git](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/git/add).

## After Committing

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## After Resetting

```
On branch main
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        example.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
