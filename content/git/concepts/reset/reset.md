In Git, the `reset` command is used to change the state of the Git repository or undo commits.

## Syntax

In the terminal, the "git reset" command can be used by typing the following:

```pseudo
git reset <mode-option> <commit-reference-number>
```

### Mode Options

The `<mode-options>` refers to how far `reset` will go when rolling back changes to a previous commit, including:

- Where the `HEAD` is pointing towards (usually done with just `git reset`).
- Whether the staging area or Index, reflects the commit the `HEAD` is now pointing towards.
- Whether the working tree is rolled back to reflect the changes reset in the `HEAD` and staging area.

More specifically, these options include:

1. --soft: This undoes the commit but still shows the file as staged and permits only new commits.
2. --mixed: This undoes the commit and unstages the file and the file can be edited and committed normally.
3. --hard: This removes the new commit including all changes and uncommitted files.

The commit can either be the commit hash generated by Git, or in reference to the HEAD.

## Example

Suppose an error was made in a file named **example.txt** and is accidentally added and committed to a Git repository, `git reset` can be used to go back to the state before that commit was made. The default `--mixed` mode resets the `HEAD` and staging area back to the previous commit.

**Note:** HEAD refers to the current commit while index refers to the staging area where files are [added using Git](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/git/add).

## After Committing

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## After Resetting

```
On branch main
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        example.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
