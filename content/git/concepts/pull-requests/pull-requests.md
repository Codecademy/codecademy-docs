Pull Requests (PRs) are used to recommend the merging of code from one branch into a different branch. PRs are a core tool in open-source software development as it allows developers to proposes changes to large, open-source codebases.

After reviewing, if the changes are approved by author(s)/collaborators of the repository, they are merged into the base branch (this is usually named the `main` branch). If they do not, then they may either ask the requester for additional changes or decline the PR altogether.

PRs are featured on popular version control platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/).

## Create a Pull Request

The prerequisites for creating a PR and contributing to are: 

1. Fork the project
2. Clone the forked repository to local machine
3. Create, and switch into, a new branch
4. Add, commit, and push the changes back to repository

With the newly added changes pushed, open the web page of the repository. There should be a button that says "Create Pull Request" placed somewhere, similar to the image below.

Click that button and follow the steps to create the PR.
