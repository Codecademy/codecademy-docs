Git statuses show the state of the working directory, staging area, and which files are untracked (names shown in red are not staged) or tracked (shown in green and staged). The tracked files which are shown in green, are the files found in the staging area and will be saved with the next commit.

For an example for the usage of the command, please refer to the `git add` command entry.
