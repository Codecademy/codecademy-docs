In Git, cloning  means copying an existing remote repository to your current directory.

Some of the basic Git commands have been performed only on a local branch, that is, a branch that exists on your computer. Here's a command that will help you interact with a remote branch &mdash; a branch on a server that can be accessed through the internet.

## Syntax

The basic syntax for cloning in Git is this:

```shell
$ git clone <repo-URL>
```

## Example

For example, if you want to clone [Codecademy Docs](https://github.com/codecademy/docs), you can do so like this:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/codecademy/docs

  Cloning into 'docs'...
