A **fork** is making a duplicate of an existing repository. This "fork" becomes a separate undertaking that the user is in charge of. Collaboration, experimentation, and contributions to open-source code are made possible by forking. It enables developers worldwide to collaborate, make changes, and contribute to projects while retaining the integrity of the source code. It is a secure approach to modify and test code without changing the original.

## Steps to Fork a Repository

### Step 1

First, Login to your GitHub account.

### Step 2

Navigate to the Github repository you want to fork.

### Step 3

Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner.
