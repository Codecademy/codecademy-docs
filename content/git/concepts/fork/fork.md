**Fork**, a central concept in open-source development via platforms like GitHub, involves creating a copy of an existing repository. This "fork" becomes an independent project under your control. Forking enables collaboration, experimentation, and contributions to open-source code. It's a safe way to modify and test code without altering the original, allowing developers worldwide to work together, make changes, and contribute to projects while maintaining the integrity of the source.

## Steps to Fork a Repository

### Step 1

Go to GitHub and log in to your account.

### Step 2

Navigate to the repository you want to fork.

### Step 3

Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository's page.

This will create a new copy of the original "Codecademy/docs" repository into your account on which you can work.
