### Subject: Git

"Git add" command is used to push a file from your working tree to the staging area(where all the files will be saved with the next commit).

In your working tree, if you create a file using the command "touch filename.extention" and you then type the git command "git status", you will see that 
the file you have created will appear in red, indicating that it is untracked. To push the file to the staging area so that it can be saved with the next
commit, use the command "git add filename.txt". If you type in the "git status", you will see that the filename now appears in green indicating that it is 
tracked and will be saved in the next commit.
