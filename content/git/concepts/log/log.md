The git `log` command is used to track the commit history of a project's repository. After running, it will display project-related information, such as a detailed commit history, which can be used to go back in time to a previous version of the project.

## Example

Below is a short example of how the `git log` command works. By running `git log` will show a list of all previous commit on current [branch](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/git/branch):

```shell
$ git log

On current branch

commit (commit hash unique number), example: f5b5bd8f9eaa443d4020cbe918x742e7ddd22000
Author : Author's name.
Date: date when changes were commited to the project.

```
