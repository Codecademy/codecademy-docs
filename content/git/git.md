Ever have an “I lost all my work and I have a deadline the next day” moment? [**Git**](https://git-scm.com) is a popular version control tool &mdash; something that developers use to save all relevant versions of their work to avoid moments like those. It also makes it easy for developers to collaborate and share work with others!

Git was created as a free and [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source) tool by [Linus Torvalds](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/linus-torvalds) in 2005 for development of the [Linux](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/linux) kernel, and it's now a fundamental developing tool that's used by almost all professional developers.
