**Term entries** refer to a piece of technical content that falls under a given concept, using examples. A common example of a term entry is one that describes a [function](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/function) or [method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method) for a given [data type](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types) or structure under a specific programming language. A list of existing terms for a given concept is usually located towards the bottom of a concept entry.

The format and structure for a Docs term entry can be seen in [this template](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/documentation/term-entry-template.md).
