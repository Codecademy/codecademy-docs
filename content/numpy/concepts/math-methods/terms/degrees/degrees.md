In NumPy, the **`.degrees()`** function converts an angle measure from radians to degrees.

## Syntax

```pseudo
numpy.degrees(x, out=None, where=True)
```

- `x`: The number or array of numbers in radians that must be converted.
- `out`: An optional parameter specifying where the result is stored.
- `where`: An optional parameter specifying a condition to filter which elements to convert.

## Example 1

```py
# Importing the 'numpy' library as 'np'
import numpy as np

# Convert a single number from radians to degrees
radNum = 4
result = np.degrees(radNum)
print(result)
```

Below is the output generated by the code snippet:

```shell
229.1831180523293
```

## Example 2

```py
# Importing the 'numpy' library as 'np'
import numpy as np

# Convert an array of numbers from radians to degrees
radArray = [ 2, 4, 5, 8]
result = np.degrees(radArray)
print(result)
```

The output generated by the code snippet is as follows:

```shell
[114.59155903 229.18311805 286.47889757 458.3662361 ]
```

## Codebyte Example

Run the following code to understand how the `.degrees()` function works:

```codebyte/python
import numpy as np

radArray = [ 1, 32, 100]
result = np.degrees(radArray)
print(result)
```
