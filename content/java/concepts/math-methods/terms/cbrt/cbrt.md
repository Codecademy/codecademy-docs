The **`Math.cbrt()`** method returns the cubed root of a double value.

## Syntax

```pseudo
Math.cbrt(double num)
```

The `Math.cbrt()` method will return the cube root of `num`. The value of `num` can be any real number.

Edge cases for the `.cbrt()` function include:
-If the argument is `NaN`, then `.cbrt()` will return `NaN`
-If the argument is infinite, then `.cbrt()` will return infinity with a matching sign as the argument
