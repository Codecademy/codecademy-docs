The **`Math.PI`** constant in Java is a static field available in the `java.lang.Math` class. It represents the mathematical constant Ï€ (pi), which is a non-repeating, irrational number approximately equal to 3.141592653589793. Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

## Syntax

```java
double val = Math.PI;
```

## Example

The following code demonstrates a basic use of the `Math.PI` constant.

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    double circle_radius = 5;
    double circle_area = Math.PI * (circle_radius * circle_radius);
    System.out.println(circle_area);
    }
}
```

This will return the following output:

```shell
78.53981633974483
```
