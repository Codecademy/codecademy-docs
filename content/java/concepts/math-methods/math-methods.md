## Math Constants

There are several mathematical constants defined in the Java `Math` class. These constants are marked as public static final, which means they are public, class-level constants with unchangeable values and can be accessed as follows:

|  Name   |       value       |                                        Definition                                         |
| :-----: | :---------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Math.PI | 3.141592653589793 |                This constant represents the mathematical constant Ï€ (pi).                 |
| Math.E  | 2.718281828459045 | This constant represents the base of the natural logarithm, also known as Euler's number. |

The Java `Math` class provides several static methods that allows us to work on mathematical calculations with numbers. These methods can be accessed by using the `Math` class with a given method:

```java
Math.method();
```

Here are the `Math` methods in alphabetical order:
