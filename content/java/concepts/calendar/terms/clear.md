The method **`clear()`** in the [`Calendar`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/calendar) class is used to reset or clear specific fields of the calendar instance to their default values. It allows you to reset individual fields, such as `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY_OF_MONTH`, `HOUR`, etc., to their initial state.

## Syntax

```pseudo
void clear()
void clear(int field)
```

> **Note:** Without any parameters, the `clear` method clears all fields of the Calendar instance, thereby resetting it to its initial state. The `clear(int field)` method allows you to clear a specific field by providing the corresponding field constant from the Calendar class.
