The method **`clear()`** in the [`Calendar`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/calendar) class is used to reset or clear specific fields of the calendar instance to their default values. It allows you to reset individual fields, such as `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY_OF_MONTH`, `HOUR`, etc., to their initial state.
