The **`.setFirstDayOfWeek()`** method of the `Calendar` class sets what the first day of all weeks will be by accepting an integer value that represents a specific day of the week. 

> **Note:** Most countries consider either Saturday, Sunday, or Monday to be the first day of the week. For example, the United States recognises Sunday as the first day of the week, while Monday is observed as the first day of the week in India.
