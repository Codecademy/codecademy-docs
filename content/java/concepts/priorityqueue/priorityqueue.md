A `PriorityQueue` is an implementation of the `Queue` interface and stores elements in a collection sorted by natural ordering or by a custom `Comparitor`. The elements are ordered with the least value element at the head of the queue, and the `Queue` methods `.peek()` and `.poll()` operate on that element.
