The **`Comparator`** interface is used to order objects of an arbitrary [class](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/classes). It is not to be confused with the [`Comparable`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/comparable) interface, which is implemented by the class to be sorted. The `Comparator` interface is implemented in a separate class.

The `Comparator` interface has a `.compare()` method that is used to compare two instances of the same class, passed as arguments. The sorting is based on the return value of `.compare()`:

| Return Value | Means                                          |
| :----------: | ---------------------------------------------- |
|    `>= 1`    | first object instance > second object instance |
|     `0`      | first object instance = second object instance |
|   `<= -1`    | first object instance < second object instance |

A Comparator class can be passed as an argument to methods such as [`Arrays.sort()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/arrays/sort) and `Collections.sort()` to specify the sort order, potentially overriding the natural sort order defined by the classâ€™s own `.compareTo()` method.

## Syntax

```pseudo
class MyComparator implements Comparator<MyClass> {
  @Override public int compare(MyClass a, MyClass b)
  {
    // Compare logic
    ...
    return result;
  }
}
```

The Comparator class `MyComparator` will define a sort order for `MyClass` using its `.compare()` method, which takes two `MyClass` instances as arguments. The `.compare()` method will use its comparison logic to return a result reflecting the relative ordering of `MyClass` `a` and `b`.

## Example

The following example defines an `Employee` class and a Comparator class that sorts based on `lastName` then on `firstName`.

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

class Employee {
  String firstName;
  String lastName;

  public Employee(String first, String last)
  {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
  }

  public String toString()
  {
    return "( " + lastName + ", " + firstName + " )";
  }
}

class EmployeeSort implements Comparator<Employee> {

  @Override public int compare(Employee valueA, Employee valueB)
  {
    if (valueA.lastName.compareTo(valueB.lastName) != 0) {
      return valueA.lastName.compareTo(valueB.lastName);
    } else {
      return valueA.firstName.compareTo(valueB.firstName);
    }
  }
}

public class SortExample {
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Employee a[] = new Employee[5];
    a[0] = new Employee("Kirk","Douglas");
    a[1] = new Employee("Mel","Brooks");
    a[2] = new Employee("Martin","Sheen");
    a[3] = new Employee("Charlie","Sheen");
    a[4] = new Employee("Michael","Douglas");

    Arrays.sort(a, new EmployeeSort());

    for (int i=0; i < a.length; i++) {
      System.out.println(a[i]);
    }
  }
}
```

This example results in the following output:

```shell
( Brooks, Mel )
( Douglas, Kirk )
( Douglas, Michael )
( Sheen, Charlie )
( Sheen, Martin )
```
