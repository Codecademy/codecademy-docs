**Proofs** are an integral part of mathematics used to verify the truthfulness and validity of statements. Proofs use logical reasoning to establish the certainty of mathematical claims, playing a crucial and indispensable role in advancing the field of mathematics. Proofs help in solving the problem partially or completely.

## Conjecture

A mathematical proof is constructed using a Conjecture. Conjecture can be thought of as a building block of mathematical proof that make up a hypothesis that can be validated using logics and patterns. 

Mathematical exploration and discovery heavily depends on the the implementation of conjecture.
