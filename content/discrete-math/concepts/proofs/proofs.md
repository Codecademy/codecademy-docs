**Proofs** is a concept of Discrete Mathematics used to verify the truthfulness and validity of statements. Proofs use logical reasoning to establish the certainty of mathematical claims, playing a crucial role in advancing the field of mathematics. Proofs help in solving the problem partially or completely.

## Conjecture

Conjecture are used to construct a mathematical proof. Conjecture can be thought of as a building block of a hypothesis that can be validated using logics and patterns.

Mathematical exploration and discovery heavily depends on the implementation of conjecture.

## Base Case

Base Case is termed as the initial or smallest value that verifies the statement to be correct. According to Principal of Mathematical Induction, Proof is bifurcated into two steps:

- Base Case (_verification of base step_): The initial or smallest value is checked to establish the truth of the statement.
- Inductive Step (_inductive hypothesis and conclusion_): Assuming the statement holds for a given value, it is shown that it also holds for the next value, extending the validity of the statement.
