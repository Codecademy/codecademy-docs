**Conditional Proof** is a technique used in mathematical proofs to demonstrate a conditional statement, by assuming the antecedent of the conditional and showing that the consequent follows.

A conditional statment is a statement of the form 'if..., then...'. The antecedent (also called 'the hypothesis') is the condition of the conditional statement: the part following 'if'. The consequent (also called 'the conclusion') is what is claimed to follow from the condition: the part following 'then'.

By assuming the antecedent and then proving that the consequent follows, given that assumption, the entire conditional is shown to be true.

## Steps for Conditional Proof

1. _Supposition for Conditional Proof_: Assume that the antecedent is true.
2. _Prove the consequent_: Prove that the consequent is true.

## Example

The following statement will be proven below: If 4 is a factor of x, then 2 is a factor of x.

### Supposition for Conditional Proof

```plaintext
Assume, for conditional proof, that for some integer n, where n â‰¥ 0, x / 4 = n.
```

### Prove the Consequent

```plaintext
First, we perform some basic algebraic manipulation on the assumption:

x / 4 = n		[by assumption above]
x = 4n			[multiplying both sides by 4]
x / 2 = 4n / 2		[dividing both sides by 2]
x / 2 = 2n		[simplifying right-hand side]

Since n is an integer value greater than or equal to 0, 2n is also an integer value greater than or equal to 0.

It follows that x / 2 is equal to an integer value greater than or equal to 0. By definition, 2 is therefore a factor of x.
