Luau is a scripting language derived from Lua. It was created for Roblox, an online game platform and game creation system. Luau is backwards compatible with Lua 5.1, meaning Lua 5.1 can be executed within the Luau environment. Luau is used by Roblox game developers to write game code and by Roblox engineers to write large parts of the user-facing application code and also portions of the Roblox Studio editor as plugins.

Luau is open-source and information on itâ€™s source code and associated tools can be found within the [Luau Repository](https://github.com/Roblox/luau#readme).
