The `.concat()` function is used to concatenate and combine multiple [`DataFrames`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/pandas/dataframe) or [`Series`] along a particular axis.

## Syntax

```pseudo
pandas.concat(objs)
```

The `objs` parameter is essential and must be specified. It represents the objects to be concatenated and can be a sequence or mapping of pandas Series or DataFrame objects. The objects should be passed as a sequence (like a list or tuple) or a mapping (like a dictionary).
