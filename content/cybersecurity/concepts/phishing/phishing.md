## Phishing Prevention

Spam filters and email security software use data on existing phishing scams and machine learning algorithms to identify suspected phishing emails (and other spam), then move them to a separate folder and disable any links they contain.

Antivirus and anti-malware software detects and neutralizes malicious files or code in phishing emails.

Multi-factor authentication requires at least one login credential in addition to a username and a passwordâ€”for example, a one-time code sent to the users' cell phone. By providing and additional last line of defense against phishing scams or other attacks that successfully compromise passwords, multi-factor authentication can undermine spear phishing attacks and prevent BEC.

Web filters prevent users from visiting known malicious web sites ('blacklisted' sites) and display alerts whenever users visit suspected malicious or fake web sites.
