A **virus** is a type of computer program that can replicate and infect a system with malicious code. Computer viruses have two main functions: propagation and destruction. Propagation is when a virus self-replicates by placing a copy of itself into other programs across a network. Destruction refers to the damage a computer virus can cause to your computer by deleting files or reformatting your hard drive.

## Virus In-Use:

A virus's payload delivers the destructive power and negatively impacts the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems or data. Common signs of computer viruses can include unwanted pop-up windows, programs that self-execute, accounts being logged out, and crashing of the device. The risk of a virus can be mitigated by installing anti-virus software, scanning on a regular basis, and backing up data.

## Different Types of Viruses

- Malware: short for malicious software. Malware is any type of software that could harm a computer system. Malware can make a computer perform actions without the ownerâ€™s consent or knowledge.

- Trojan Horse: a type of malware that uses code to install seemingly benign software, but it is actually used to create back doors into a system. The result is typically loss or theft of data.

- Worm: a piece of malicious software that replicates itself in order to spread to other systems. It often traverses across a network, exploiting security flaws on the target system to allow access.

- Spyware: software that tries to monitor and gather information about a user without their knowledge or consent. Spyware can monitor and log activity on a target system, or gather credit card and other personally identifiable information.
