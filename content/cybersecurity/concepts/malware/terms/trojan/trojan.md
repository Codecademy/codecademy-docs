A **trojan** is a type of malware that downloads onto a computer disguised as a legitimate program. The delivery method typically sees an attacker use social engineering to hide malicious code within legitimate software to try and gain users' system access with their software. 

## How Trojans Work

Unlike computer viruses, a trojan horse cannot manifest by itself, so it needs a user to download the server side of the application for it to work. This means the executable file should be implemented and the program installed for the trojan to attack a device’s system. Once installed, the malicious code will execute the task the attacker designed it for, such as gain backdoor access to corporate systems, spy on users’ online activity, or steal sensitive data.

## Spread Mechanisms

A trojan get hidden as free-to-download files or spreads through legitimate-looking emails and files attached to emails, which are spammed to reach the inboxes of as many people as possible. When the email is opened and the malicious attachment is downloaded, the trojan server will install and automatically run every time the infected device is turned on. 

Devices can also be infected by a trojan through social engineering tactics, which cyber criminals use to coerce users into downloading a malicious application. The malicious file could be hidden in banner advertisements, pop-up advertisements, or links on websites. 

Trojans can also attack and infect smartphones and tablets using a strand of mobile malware. This could occur through the attacker redirecting traffic to a device connected to a Wi-Fi network and then using it to launch cyberattacks.

## Examples of Trojan Horse Virus Attacks

Well-known examples of Trojans include:

- Rakhni Trojan: The Rakhni Trojan delivers ransomware or a cryptojacker tool—which enables an attacker to use a device to mine cryptocurrency—to infect devices. 
- Tiny Banker: Tiny Banker enables hackers to steal users’ financial details. It was discovered when it infected at least 20 U.S. banks.
- Zeus or Zbot: Zeus is a toolkit that targets financial services and enables hackers to build their own Trojan malware. The source code uses techniques like form grabbing and keystroke logging to steal user credentials and financial details.
