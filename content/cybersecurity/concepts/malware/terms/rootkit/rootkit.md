**Rootkit** is a type of [malware](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/malware) and a program, or a collection of software tools, covertly grants cybercriminals the ability to gain remote access on a targeted computer or system. The term "rootkit" originates from [Unix](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/unix)-based operating systems, such as [Linux](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/linux), where the most privileged account is referred to as "root". The applications that provide unauthorized access to the device at the root or admin level are referred to as the "kit".

## Malicious Effects of Rootkit

Rootkits have great power in hiding and can hide in files, registry settings, or processes and steal user information. A rootkit opens a backdoor on victims' systems to introduce malicious software, including [viruses](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/malware/virus), [ransomware](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/malware/ransomware), keyloggers, or other malware, or systems that can exploit active security networks.
Rootkits attempt to prevent malware from being detected by disabling endpoint antimalware and antivirus software. Although most rootkits affect the software and operating system, some can also infect your computer's hardware and firmware.

## Types of RootKit

There are different types of rootkits, and they fall into different categories based on what they do and how long they stay on your system. The ones listed here are the most well-known, but there are even more types out there.

| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Kernel mode rootkit | Designed to manipulate critical and system files of operating systems<br>and can inject malicious code into the operating system's kernel data structure.                                                                                                                                                        |
| User mode rootkit   | Known by the name application rootkit, it replaces standard computer files with rootkit files<br>and may even change the way standard programs work.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Firmware rootkit    | Hardware or firmware rootkits can affect your router or BIOS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Bootloader rootkit  | Bootloader rootkits or bootkits replace the legitimate bootloader with a corrupted version,<br>compromising the computer's loading process.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Memory rootkit      | Memory rootkits hide in the computer's RAM (Random Access Memory)<br>and use computer resources to perform malicious activities in the background.<br>Since memory rootkits only reside in the computer's RAM and do not inject malicious code permanently,<br>they disappear as soon as the system is rebooted. |

## Rootkit Installation Methods

Rootkits are installed through the same common vectors as any malicious software, including email phishing campaigns, executable malicious files, malvertising, removable media like USB, crafted malicious document files like Microsoft Word, connecting to shared drives that have been compromised, or downloading software infected with the rootkit from risky websites.

## Probable Rootkit Symptoms

Identifying a rootkit is challenging without the aid of specialized tools since various malware exhibit similar destructive behavior. However, certain situations may indicate the presence of a rootkit in the system. Here are some examples:

- Difficulty in Detection,
- Unclear Network Activity,
- Unusual System Behavior,
- Slow Performance,
- Disabled Security Software,
- Unexpected System Modifications.

## Rootkit Preventions

Similar precautions can be taken to prevent the rootkit from infiltrating the system. A few of these measures include:

- Keep The system and software updated,
- Run security scans regularly,
- Don't click on suspicious links,
- Don't install unknown software form unreliable sources.
