**Malware** is malicious software that is intentionally designed to infiltrate, harm, or disable computer systems, networks, and devices. Depending on the malware's objective, the type of malware can vary, from theft to financial gain to sabotaging the ability to access the system.

## Types of Malware

There are different types of malware for different objectives, some of which are:

- [Virus](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/virus) - attach themselves to other programs and replicate once installed.
- Spyware - monitors user activities and reports back to the author.
- Adware - designed to show advertisements to trick users into installing malicious software.
- [Ransomware](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/ransomware) - designed to lock and encrypt files to force the user into paying a ransom to regain access.
- Trojans - most dangerous of malware types. It can be used to steal financial information or install other types of malware.
- Worms - similar to viruses, they are self-replicating but have the ability to spread across systems on their own.
- Keyloggers - malware that records the user's keystrokes, records the data, and reports back to the author.
- Rootkits - provides "root" access to the author and is designed to stay hidden from the user, other software, and the operating system itself.

## Countermeasures to avoid Malware

- Update the operating system and security software when possible; outdated software may contain [vulnerabilities](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/vulnerability) which makes it easier for the device to get infected.
- Never click links that are found on suspicious popups or websites, especially those that offer a free method to paid programs.
- Never leave the device unattended and unlocked in a public place; applications disguised as spyware can be installed without the user's knowledge.
- Beware of emails that appear to be from banking institutions requesting to click a link to update the password or regain access to the account. It is recommended to visit the official online banking site and log in from there.
- Only purchase and download software and programs from official websites or retail stores. Do not download from suspicious sites offering paid programs for free, as they may contain malware.
