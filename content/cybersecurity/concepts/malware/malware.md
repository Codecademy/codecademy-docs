**Malware** is malicious software that is intentionally designed to infiltrate, harm, or disable computer systems, networks, and devices. Depending on the malware's objective, the type of malware can vary from theft, to financial gain, to sabotaging the ability to access the system.

## Types of Malware

There are different types of malware for different objectives, some of which are:

- A [virus](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/virus) attached itself to other programs and replicates once installed.
- Spyware monitors user activities and reports back to the author.
- Adware is designed to show advertisements to trick users into installing malicious software.
- [Ransomware](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/ransomware) is designed to lock and encrypt files to force the user into paying a ransom to regain access.
- Trojans are the most dangerous type of malware. It can be used to steal financial information or install other types of malware.
- Worms are similar to viruses. They are self-replicating but have the ability to spread across systems on their own.
- Keyloggers are malware that records the user's keystrokes, records the data, and reports back to the author.
- Rootkits provide "root" access to the author and is designed to stay hidden from the user, other software, and the operating system itself.

## Countermeasures to Avoid Malware

- Update the operating system and security software when possible; outdated software may contain [vulnerabilities](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/vulnerability) which makes it easier for the device to get infected.
- Never click links that are found on suspicious popups or websites, especially those that offer a free method to paid programs.
- Never leave a device unattended and unlocked in a public place; applications disguised as spyware can be installed without the user's knowledge.
- Beware of emails that appear to be from banking institutions requesting to click a link to update the password or regain access to the account. It is recommended to visit the official online banking site and log in from there.
- Only purchase and download software and programs from official websites or retail stores. Do not download from suspicious sites offering paid programs for free, as they may contain malware.
