**Ransomware** is a [cyber attack](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/cyber-attack) that blocks and prevents a user from accessing important files or personal data that is located on a device or computer.

## Preventing Ransomware

There are various basic countermeasures:

- Use secured networks when possible. Using unsecured networks will leave the device unprotected and increases the [risk](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/risk) of ransomware infecting the device. The use of an [Virtual-Private-Network](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/virtual-private-network) is reccomended to secure and encrypt the connection to protect against threats.
- Perform frequent backups of important data and store them on a separate device that cannot be accessed from the network. If a device is infected with ransomware, it is possible to restore the device to a previous state before infection occurred.
