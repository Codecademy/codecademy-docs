A **DDoS** is a [cyber attack](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/cyber-attack) where a company or organization's websites and servers are unable to function effectively due to their network services are disrupted in an attempt to access their resources until they are no longer needed, ultimately leading to said websites and servers to stop working altogether.

## Types of DDOS Attacks

DDoS attacks typically come in three categories:

1. Volumetric(raw attack volume) attacks: Utilizes methods to generate volumes of online traffic to a company's website, causing its' bandwidth to be saturated and the flow of online viewership to be disjointed.
2. Protocol attacks: Destroys the processing capacity of network infrastructure resources like servers, firewalls, and load balancers. This happens when malicious connection requests target by Layer 3 and 4 protocol connection requests.
3. Application Attacks: Opens connections and initiating process and transaction requests that consume finite resources like disk space and memory storage. This occurs when weaknesses in the application layer are manipulated

## Signs of a DDOS-infected device

- Slow access to files.
- Unable to access a specific website.
- No internet access.
- Continuous appearances of spam emails.

## How to Respond to a DDOS Attack

- Provide training for staff members to recognize the signs of a DDoS attack.
- Use online outage mitigation and response strategies.
- Assess ongoing DDoS risks through tests that mimic these attacks.
- Implement the technological tools that can handle the overflow of high Web traffics. Cloud-based Web servers like [AWS Shield](https://aws.amazon.com/shield/) are often recommended for this task.
