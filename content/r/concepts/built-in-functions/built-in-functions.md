R has **built-in functions** that can perform a variety of tasks. Some of the common ones are listed below:

 - `min()`: returns the *minimum* value of a vector
 - `max()`: returns the *maximum* value of a vector
 - `mean()`: returns the *mean* value of a vector
 - `median()`: returns the *median* value of a vector
 - `range()`: returns the *minimum* **and** *maximum* values of a vector
 - `print()`: displays whatever you include within the parentheses in the console - could be a dataframe, vector, phrase, etc.
