CSS uses units to measure the values of various properties in a stylesheet. The two main types of units are: 

* Absolute Units

* Relative Units

## Absolute Units

These are CSS units that are of fixed lengths and not relative to any other styles. This includes: 

* `px` - Pixels (most common one)

* `pt` - Points 

* `mm` - Millimeters

## Relative Units

These are CSS units whose size is relative to some other length. They could relate to things like:

* the font-size of a direct parent element
* the default font-size of the HTML body
* the size of the viewport 

Some common relative units include: 

* `em` - (most common one) property size relative to property size of direct parent element

* `rem` - property size relative to property size of direct root element

* `vw` - percentage based on width of screen

* `vh` - percentage based on height of screen
