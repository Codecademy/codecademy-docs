The CSS `height` and `width` properties are used to set the height and width of an element. They do not include padding, borders, or margins of the element, but instead, the height/width of the area *inside* the padding, border, and margin.

The `height` and `width` properties may have the following values:

- `auto` (default): The browser calculates the height and width.
- `length`: Defines the height/width in px, cm, etc.
- `%`: Defines the height/width in percent of the containing block.
- `initial`: Sets the height/width to its default value.
- `inherit`: The height/width will be inherited from its parent value.
