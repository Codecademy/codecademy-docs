## Definition

Set space between words.

## Syntax

```css
word-spacing: <word-spacing-value>;
```

 The CSS units for `word-spacing-value` can be:

- `px`
- `em`

## Example 2

Set the space between words in `p` tag to `0.5em`:

```css
p {
  word-spacing: 0.5em;
}
```

For word spacing, using `em` values are recommended because the spacing can be set based on the size of the font.
