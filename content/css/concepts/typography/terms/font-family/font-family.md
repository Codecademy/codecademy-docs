## Definition

Specify the typeface in a rule set.

## Syntax

```css
font-family: <font-family-name>;
```

where `<font-family-name>` can be the following:

- `Roboto`
- `"Open Sans"`
- or can be selected from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) that suites you.

If a font family name is not available, browsers will display their default font. When using a multi-word font name, it is best practice to wrap them in quotes.

## Example 1

Set the `p` tag to `Roboto`:

```css
p {
  font-family: Roboto;
}
```

## Example 2

Set the `h1` tag to `"Open Sans"`:

```css
h1 {
  font-family: "Open Sans";
}
```
