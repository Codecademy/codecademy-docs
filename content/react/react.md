React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or webpage components. It was released in 2013 and is currently maintained by Facebook along with a community of developers and companies.

It is component-based. An example of a component could be a form or even just a form field or button on a website. In React, applications are completely built with components.

Some of the most persistent issues of [front-end development](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/front-end) are solved with React, allowing one to build dynamic and interactive web apps with ease. It is fast, scalable, flexible, powerful, and has a robust developer community thatâ€™s rapidly growing.

## Mobile and Desktop Development

React Native is a JavaScript framework that uses React. With React Native, developers can apply web-based React principles to creating mobile apps for Android and iOS. Here, React is used to connect the mobile user interface of the application to the phone's operating system.

Developers can also use React with Electron, another JavaScript library, to create cross-platform desktop apps. Some apps you may know about that are built with Electron include Visual Studio Code, Slack, Skype, Discord, WhatsApp, and WordPress Desktop.
