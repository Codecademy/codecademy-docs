React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It was released in 2013 and currently maintained by Facebook and a community of developers and companies.

It offers graceful solutions to some of front-end programming’s most persistent issues, allowing one to build dynamic and interactive web apps with ease. It’s fast, scalable, flexible, powerful, and has a robust developer community that’s rapidly growing. <!-- # Write up an introductory description of the language here! -->
