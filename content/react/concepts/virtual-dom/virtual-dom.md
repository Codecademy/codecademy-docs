In React, Virtual DOM is a conceptual representation of application's UI as it relates to the UI in the actual DOM. When changes are made to the UI and there's a re-render, they are compared to the relevant branches in the DOM-tree. Then, the changes are applied to the DOM-tree.

The Virtual DOM is not to be confused with the Shadow DOM, or any other technology or concept.
