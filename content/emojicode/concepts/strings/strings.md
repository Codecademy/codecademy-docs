A string is a sequence of characters contained within a pair of single quotes (`'`) or double quotes(`"`). They provide a way to store something like a word, sentence, or whole paragraph. They can be any length and can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.

_Strings_ are words or pieces of text that the computer treats as a single item. A string is a sequence of characters. It can be any length and contain any letters, numbers, symbols, or spaces surrounded by `🔤`'s.

Here are four different examples of strings:

```emojic
🔤This is a string!🔤
🔤This is also a string!!!🔤
🔤1337🔤
🔤👆👍🔤
```

It’s important to distinguish between strings and the rest of the code in our programs. Every part of a program is made up of characters, but strings are the parts we intend to keep as data—not as instructions to be executed by the computer.

Here's a full program that print out two strings:

```emojic
