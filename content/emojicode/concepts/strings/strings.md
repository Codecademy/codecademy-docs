_Strings_ are words or pieces of text that the computer treats as a single item. They provide a way to store something like a word, sentence, or whole paragraph. 

Technically speaking, a string is a sequence of characters. It can be of any length and contain any letters, numbers, symbols, or spaces as long as they are surrounded by `🔤`'s.

## Syntax

Here are four different strings in Emojicode:

```emojic
🔤This is a string!🔤
🔤This is also a string!!!🔤
🔤1337🔤
🔤👆👍🔤
```

It’s important to distinguish between strings and the rest of the code in our programs. Every part of a program is made up of characters, but strings are the parts we intend to keep as data—not as instructions to be executed by the computer.

## Example

Here's a full program that print out two strings:

```emojic
🏁 🍇
  😀 🔤2020...🔤❗️
  😀 🔤That was a crazy year.🔤❗️
🍉
```
