The 🔂 statement allows you to quickly iterate over an instance, that is repeatedly retrieving values from it until there are no more values to provide. 

For example, you can iterate over an 🍨 instance and you’ll receive all elements contained in the list. 

## Syntax

```emojic
🏁 🍇
  🍿 🔤cookies🔤 🔤milk🔤 🔤eggs🔤 🔤blueberries🔤 🍆 ➡️ grocery

  🔂 item grocery 🍇
    😀 item❗️
  🍉
🍉
```

The output would be:

```bash
cookies
milk
eggs
blueberries
```

In this example, the code block will be repeated for every value of the list and the values are printed. The type of `item` is naturally 🔡.
