Emojicode is a real programming language with playful syntax like `😀 🔤Hello, world!🔤❗️` in place of traditional programming keywords. Learning it can bring some smiles and fun to your programming journey, as well be an enlightening experience in which you will never look at your go-to programming language the same way again. <!-- # Write up an introductory description of the language here! -->
