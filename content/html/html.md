HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of all web pages. It was created by Tim Berneres-Lee in 1993 to define the structure of a web page. Without it, you wouldnâ€™t be able to organize text or add images or videos to your pages. HTML is the beginning of everything you need to know to make your first website.
