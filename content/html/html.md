**HTML**, short for **HyperText Markup Language**, is the foundation of all web pages. It was created by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/historical-technical-figures/tim-berners-lee) in 1993 to define the structure of a web page. Without it, you wouldnâ€™t be able to organize text or add images or videos to your pages. HTML is the beginning of everything you need to know to make your first website.

## HTML Structure

HTML is organized into a family tree structure. HTML elements can have parents, grandparents, siblings, children, grandchildren, etc.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title of the document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      <h1>Heading 1</h1>
      <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
