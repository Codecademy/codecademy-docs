The `<u>` tag is used to mark HTML text to be displayed with an underline or other non-textual annotation. The default rendering of this tag is a simple solid underline, but it may be altered using CSS.

**Note:** While historically this tag was used to underline text, it should now be avoided for solely styling text. Modern best practice to use CSS for text formatting.

## Syntax

```html
<u><!-- text which should be annotated goes here --></u>
