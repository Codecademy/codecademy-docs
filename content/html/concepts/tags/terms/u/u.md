The `<u>` tag is used to mark HTML text to be displayed with a non-textual annotation. The default rendering of this tag is a simple solid underline, but it may be altered using CSS.

**Note:** While historically this tag was used just to underline text, it should now be avoided for solely styling text. Modern best practice to use [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css) for text formatting. The CSS element used for underlining text is [`text-decoration`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/typography/text-decoration).

## Syntax

```html
<u><!-- text which should be annotated goes here --></u>
```

The `<u>` tag should only contain text content or other tags meant for text content.

## Example

```html
<p>
  You can use this tag to indicate things such as <u>mispelt</u> words.
</p>
```
