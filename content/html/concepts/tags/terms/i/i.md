The `<i>` tag is used to set off HTML text, indicating idiomatic expressions, technical terms, taxonomical designations and so on. Typically this is illustrated by displaying the text in italics.
  
**Note:** While historically this tag was used just to italicize text, it should now be avoided for solely styling text. Modern best practice to use [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css) for text formatting. The CSS element used to italicize text is [`font-style`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/typography/font-style).

## Syntax

```html
<i><!-- text which should be set off goes here --></i>
```

The `<i>` tag should only contain text content or other tags meant for text content.

## Example

```html
<p>The technical term for the &lt;i&gt; tag is the <i>Idiomatic Text</i> Element</p>
```
