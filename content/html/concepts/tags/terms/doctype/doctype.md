The `<!DOCTYPE>` tag tells the browser that the current file is written in HTML and not another type such as JavaScript or CSS.

## How to Use

The `<!DOCTYPE>` tag is added to the top of an HTML file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title of the document</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    The content of the document......
  </body>
</html>
```
