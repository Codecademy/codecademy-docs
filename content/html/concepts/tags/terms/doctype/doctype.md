The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration tells the browser that a given file is a markup **.html** file and that a set of web standards must be applied to it. It is the first line of code that go at the top of every HTML or XHTML file.

**Note:** `<!DOCTYPE>` is not an element or a tag.

## Syntax

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

## Example

The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is added to the top of an HTML file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title of the document</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    The content of the document...
  </body>
</html>
```
