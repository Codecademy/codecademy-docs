Used to add an image to the document. It can also be used inside an anchor tag to create an image link.

## Syntax

```html
<img src="image URL" alt="text used for accessibility" />
```

`<img>` is a tag that has no closing tag, meaning that it cannot have tags inside of it. It uses attributes to set properties, some common attributes are:

- `src`: the URL location of the image
- `alt`: alternative text used by screen readers and when the image does not load
- `height`: the height of the image, in pixels
- `width`: the width of the image, in pixels

## Example

Below is an example of an image wrapped in an anchor tag which creates an image link:

```html
<html>
  <head> </head>
  <body>
    <a href="https://codecademy.com">
      <img src="logo.png" alt="Codecademy Home Page" width="256" height="64" />
    </a>
  </body>
</html>
```
