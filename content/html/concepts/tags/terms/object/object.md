The `<object>` tag represents some resource external to the HTML document. This resource can be treated as an image, an embedded browsing context, or as content to be handled by a browser plugin."

The `<object>` tag requires at least the `type` and `data` attributes specified. The `type` attribute tels the browser what MIME type of content is to be displayed, such as "application/pdf", "application/x-java-applet" or "audio/mp4". The `data` attribute contains the URL to the resource being used.

## Syntax

```html
<object type="MIME type" data="URL of resource"></object>
```
