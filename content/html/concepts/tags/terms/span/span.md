In HTML, the `<span>` tag is used for grouping text or elements together for styling and scripting. Unlike the block-level [`<div>` tag](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/tags/div), `<span>` is an inline tag that is usually wrapped inside another tag. ([`<li>`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/tags/li), [`<p>`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/paragraphs), etc.)

This tag should only be used whenever there is no [semantic element](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/semantic-html) to use instead.

## Syntax

```pseudo
<span attributes=""><!-- Place content here. --></span>
```

The `<span>` tag can be selected with [attributes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/attributes), such as `class` or `style`.

## Example

In the example below, a familiar poem is marked up with `<span>` wrapped in a single `<p>` tag:

```html
<p>
  Roses are <span style="color: red;">Red</span>,<br />
  Violets are <span style="color: blue;">Blue</span>,<br />
  We think HTML is <span style="color: orange">awesome</span>!<br />
  What about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span>?
</p>
```
