## Definition 

The `<em>` tag represents text which is emphasized. Browsers will show the enclosed text in italics, by default.

## Syntax

```html
<em><!-- Emphasized text goes here --></em>
``` 

`<em>` is a tag that wraps around text. By default it is an inline element, and will be shown in italics.

## Example

```html
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- The words 'very important' will be emphasized -->
    <p>Here is some text, and this part is <em>very important</em>. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
