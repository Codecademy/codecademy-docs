```html
<input>
``` 

`<input>` is a tag that has no closing tag, meaning that it cannot have tags inside of it. It uses attributes to set properties, some common attributes are:

* `type`: represents the input type, common values include
  * `text`: creates a single-line text box
  * `email`: creates a single-line text box that can validate email addresses
  * `password`: creates a single-line text box that hides the input from view
  * `checkbox`: creates a box that can be selected/deselected
  * `radio`: creates a radio button allowing a user to select one choice from many options
  * `number`: creates a text box that accepts numeric inputs only
  * `range`: creates a slider that can accept values from a certain range
  * `date`: creates a calendar picker to choose a date
  * `time`: creates a text field for entering valid times
  * `file`: creates a button that allows the user to send a file with the other form data
  * `submit`: creates a button to submit a form
* `autocomplete`: allows the browser to help the user fill in the field with previously typed data
* `minlength` and `maxlength`: set the minimum and maximum length of the text, email, password inputs
* `min` and `max`: set the minimum and maximum values for numeric inputs, ranges, dates, and times
* `disabled`: marks the input field so that it will not accept input
* `checked`: used with radio buttons to indicate which one is currently selected, and checkboxes to indicate if it is currently checked
