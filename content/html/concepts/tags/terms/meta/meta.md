Represents an interface to provide metadata pertaining to the document. Metadata is data that is used to describe the document that contains it. The `<meta>` must be placed inside `<head>` section for the document.

## Syntax

```html
<meta>
``` 

`<meta>` is a tag that has no closing tag, meaning that it cannot have tags inside of it. It uses attributes to set properties, some common attributes are:

* `charset`: describes the character encoding used when writing the document
* `name`: describes the type of meta tag, may include things like `"author"`, `"description"`, `"keywords"`, and `"color-scheme"`
* `content`: accompanies `name` to provide the appropriate content specific to the value of `name`.

## Example

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Sets the character set used to create this HTML file -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <!-- Details the author of the document -->
    <meta name="author" content="Jasmine the Gorilla">
    <!-- Provides a description used to improve discovery in search engines -->
    <meta name="description" content="A short fable about the origin of bananas, and the joy they provide.">
    <!-- Sets the color scheme to dark if possible, but lets the browser know that light will render correctly, too -->
    <meta name="color-scheme" content="dark light">
  </head>
  
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
