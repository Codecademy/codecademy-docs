The `<b>` element is used to draw the reader's attention to the marked text without assigning any additional importance to it. This is typically done by making the text bold.

**Note:** While historically this tag was used just to set text as bold, it should now be avoided for solely styling text. Modern best practice to use [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css) for text formatting. The CSS element used for making boldface text is [`font-weight`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/typography/font-weight).

## Syntax

```html
<b>
  <!-- Text to draw attention to here -->
</b>
```

The `<b>` tag should only contain text or other tags meant for text content.

## Example

```html
<p>Please pay attention to <b>this</b> word.</p>
```
