The `<embed>` tag renders an element that wraps around interactive content, including images, videos, and even other web pages. This is achieved with tools such as browser plug-ins. However, since most modern browsers no longer support plug-ins, there are other tags to use instead of `<embed>`. This includes:

- Playing video content with the [`<video>`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/tags/video) tag.
- Displaying images with the [`<img>`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/tags/img) tag.
- Rendering additional markup with the [`<iframe>`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/tags/iframe) tag.

Since those tags are available, using the `<embed>` tag is discouraged.

## Syntax

The `<embed>`tag is self-closing and accepts at least four properties:

- The `type` of content to be embedded.
- The `src` of the content.
- The content's `height`, measured in pixels.
- The content's `width`, measured in pixels.

    <embed type="image/jpg" src="my_image.jpg" width="300" height="200" />
  </body>
</html>
```
