The `<blink>` tag is an obsolete tag that was used historically to make text flash on and off. It is non-standard, depreciated, and not part of the current [HTML specifications](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/).

Using this element is a bad design practice and is discouraged by [accessibility standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). The [CSS specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2021/) allows browsers to ignore this tag.

## Syntax

```html
<!-- Not advised to use this tag! -->
<blink><!-- Blinking text goes here --></blink>
```
