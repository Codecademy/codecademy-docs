The `<blink>` tag is an obsolete tag that was used historically to make the text it contained flash on and off. It is non-standard, depreciated, and not part of the HTML specifications and should not be used.

Using this element is bad design practice and is discouraged by accesability standards. The CSS specification allows browsers to ignore this tag.

## Syntax

```html
<!-- Don't use this tag! -->
<blink><!-- blinking text goes here --></blink>
```
