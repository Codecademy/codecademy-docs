The `<blink>` tag is an obsolete tag that was used historically to make text flash on and off. It is non-standard, depreciated, and not part of the HTML specifications.

Using this element is a bad design practice and is discouraged by accessibility standards. The CSS specification allows browsers to ignore this tag.

## Syntax

```html
<!-- Don't use this tag! -->
<blink><!-- blinking text goes here --></blink>
```
