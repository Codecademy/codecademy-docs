The `<kbd>` tag makes characters look like they are keys on a keyboard.

## Syntax

All that is needed to be done is put the characters between an opening and closing tag. The `<kbd>` tag has no attributes. They can be nested but the result will be the same.

## Example 1

```html
<p>You can copy text by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>.</p>
```

Result:

You can copy text by pressing ``CTRL`` + ``c``.

## Example 2

```html
<p>You can peaste text by pressing <kbd><kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd></kbd>.</p>
```
Result:

You can peaste text by pressing ``CTRL`` + ``c``.
