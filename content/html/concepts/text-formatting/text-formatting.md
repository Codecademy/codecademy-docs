There are two ways to format text with HTML. One way is to use [HTML tags](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/tags), which specify some characteristic of the text that should cause it to render differently. The other way is to use the `style` attribute with [CSS typography properties](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/typography) to define specific formatting for a text element.

**Note:** Modern HTML specifications eschew using HTML tags to specify specific formatting of elements (bold, underline, italic etc.), instead using HTML to describe the characteristics of the text, allowing the software rendering the HTML to decide how tags are displayed. Best practice to define specific styling of text is to use [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css).
