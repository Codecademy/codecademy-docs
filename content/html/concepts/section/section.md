The `<section>` tag in HTML is a generic element that defines a section of a document. It can be nested within other section tags to create a hierarchical structure, and it can be used to group related content together. This can help to improve the accessibility and readability of your web pages.

## Syntax

```html
<section>
    <!-- Content -->
</section>
```

## Example

```html
<section>
    <h1>This is a section</h1>
    <p>This is the content of the section.</p>
</section>
```

<section>
    <h1>This is a section</h1>
    <p>This is the content of the section.</p>
</section>
