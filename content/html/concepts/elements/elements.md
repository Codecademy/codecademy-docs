An HTML element is a piece of content in an HTML document and uses the following syntax:

```html
<opening tag> content <closing tag>
```

The HTML element is everything from the opening tag to the closing tag:

```html
<p>Hello World!</p>
```

- `<p>` is the opening tag.
- `Hello World!` is the content.
- `</p>` is the closing tag.

Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the `<br>` element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

## Nested HTML Elements

HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):

```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
  ```
