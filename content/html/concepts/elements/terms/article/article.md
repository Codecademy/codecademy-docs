The `<article>` tag defines an independent, self-contained piece of content. It is most commonly used to represent a blog post, news article, forum post, or other type of content that can stand on its own. It is similar to the `<div>` element in terms of how it is displayed, but it provides more semantic information to screen readers, search engines, and third-party applications.

## Syntax

```html
<article>
    <!-- Content -->
</article>
```

## Example

```html
<article>
    <h1>This is an article</h1>
    <p>This is the body of the article.</p>
</article>

```
