The **`<hr>`** element is used to represent a semantic break between text elements. For example, a switch in topic.

> **Note:** The **`<hr>`** tag is only for semantic distinction. Best practice to create a horizontal line for presentational purposes is to use [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css).

## Syntax

```html
<hr />
```

The `<hr>` element should be used to seperate other elements at a semantic break.

## Example

```html
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<hr />
<p>This is a different paragraph</p>
```
