The **`<hr>`** element is used to represent a semantic break between text elements. For example, a switch in topic.

**Note:** The **`<hr>`** tag is only for semantic distinction. Best practice to create a horizontal line for presentational purposes is to use [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css).

## Syntax

```html
<hr />
```

The `<b>` element should only contain text or other tags meant for text content.

## Example

```html
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<hr />
<p>This is a different paragraph</p>
```
