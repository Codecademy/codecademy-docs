The `<time>` semantic tag represents a specific date, time or duration, 

## Syntax

```html
<time>
  <!-- Mark content goes inside the tag -->
</time>
```

`<mark>` requires a closing tag and wraps around a block of text. By default, browsers will render it as black font on a yellow background, but this can be changed via CSS.

## Example

### Highlighting key concepts

A typical usage example would be to highlight key concepts in a text, so that they immediately stand out to the reader and can be easily singled out.

```html
<html>
  <head> </head>
  <body>
    <p>
        <!-- Main concepts in the paragraph are enclosed in <mark> tags and will be rendered highlighted  -->
The <mark>properties</mark> of the noble gases can be well explained by modern theories of atomic structure: Their <mark>outer shell of valence electrons</mark> is considered to be <mark>"full"</mark>, giving them little tendency to participate in chemical reactions, and it has been possible to prepare only a few hundred noble gas compounds. The melting and boiling points for a given noble gas are close together, differing by less than 10 °C (18 °F); that is, they are <mark>liquids over only a small temperature range</mark>.

  </body>
</html>
