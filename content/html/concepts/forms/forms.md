The HTML `<form>` element is used to collect and send information to an external source.

`<form>` can contain various input elements. When a user submits the form, information in these input elements is passed to the source which is named in the `action` attribute of the form.

## Syntax

```html
<form method="post" action="http://server1">
  Enter your name:
  <input type="text" name="fname">
  <br/>
  
  Enter your age:
  <input type="text" name="age">
  <br/>
  
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

## Submitting a Form

Once we have collected information in a form we can send that information somewhere else by using the `action` and `method` attribute: 

- The `action` attribute tells the form to send the information. A URL is assigned that determines the recipient of the information.
- The `method` attribute tells the form what to do with that information once itâ€™s sent. An HTTP verb is assigned to the `method` attribute that determines the action to be performed.

```html
<form action="/index3.html" method="PUT"></form>
```

## Required Attribute

In HTML, input fields have an attribute called `required` which specifies that the field must include a value.

The example code block shows an input field that is required. The attribute can be written as `required="true"` or simply `required`.

```html
<input type="password" name="password" required>
```
