**Collections** in SwiftUI represent data structures used to organize, manage, and present multiple elements in a structured and adaptable manner within the app's user interface.

## Syntax

Collections are created by declaring variables with specific types:

```pseudo
@State var myCollection: [DataType] = [InitialData]
```

Collections can use using various view structures such as [List](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/swiftui/lists), [Form](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/swiftui/views/form), ForEach, and [VStack](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/swiftui/views/vstack), each tailored for different scenarios and data types. These views provide a structured way to organize and display elements within your app's user interface.

## Arrays
