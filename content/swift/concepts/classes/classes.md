Classes serve as a template to define characteristics and behaviors of an object.

They are reference types, meaning all _instances_ of a class carry the same characteristics and behaviors.

An instance is an object created based on a class.

## Syntax

In Swift, classes are defined using the `class` keyword, followed by a class name, and a pair of curly braces `{}`.

```swift
class Employee {
  // Class body
}
```

**Note:** Class names should be capitalized as per convention.
