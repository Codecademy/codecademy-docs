In Swift, when a function is associated with a type it is known as a **Method**. There are two types of Methods we use in Swift: **Instance Methods** and **Type Methods**.

## Instance Methods
Instance Methods are called on object instances.


## Type Methods
Type methods are called on the class itself, not on a specific object instance.
