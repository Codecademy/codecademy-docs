A dictionary is an unordered collection of paired data, or key-value pairs.

```swift
var dictionaryName = [
  "Key1": "Value1",
  "Key2": "Value2",
  "Key3": "Value3"
]
```

Keys can be be used to access, remove, add, or modify its associated value. Every key in a dictionary is unique.

```swift
// Each key is unique even if they all contain the same value
 
var fruitStand = [
  "Coconuts": 12,
  "Pineapples": 12,
  "Papaya": 12
]
```
