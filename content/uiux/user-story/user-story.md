A **User Story** is general description of a product from the perspective of the end-user. It can help articulate how a feature provides value to the user experience. User stories should be concise, describing who the user is, what the user wants to accomplish and why.

## Examples

 - As an avid shutterbug, I need to store my photos temporarily so I can decide which ones go on to be edited.

 - As a student, I want to keep my notes organized so I can spend more time studying and less time looking for my notes.
