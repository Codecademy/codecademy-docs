**Fitts' Law**, initially developed by Paul Fitts, is a term related to UI and UX Design describing how movement time to a target (link, button, etc.), with a pointer (mouse, finger, etc.), is a function of the distance to the target as well as the size of the target. Where poor functionality was once attributed solely to human error, Fitts first recognized this was also due to poor design.

Fitts determined larger targets with minimal spacing allow for greater usability in design. Though caution should be used when limiting spacing, as clutter can cause poor functionality issues as well. When designing a UI, it is important to recognize the user's workflow on a given page and optimally place targets according to the predicted placement of the pointer. The larger a target can be, the better for usability and limiting user error. Clustering of commonly used items and menus should be taken into consideration for optimal UX.

## Example

The gif below depicts a basic demonstration of Fitts' Law. The varying size and placement of targets illustrate the differing levels of user accuracy in acquiring each target as well as the speed of acquiring each target. As targets are enlarged and distance reduced, accuracy/speed icrease.
