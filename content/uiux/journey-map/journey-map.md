### Journey Maps
A journey map is a visualization of the process that a person goes through in order to accomplish a goal. In basic form the journey mapping starts by compiling a series of user actions into a timeline. Then, the timeline is fleshed out with user thoughts and emotions in order to create a narrative which best fits that users persona throughout the customers journey.
