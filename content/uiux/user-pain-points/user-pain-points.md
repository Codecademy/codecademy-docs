**User pain points** are areas of difficulty or frustration a user encounters when using a website or program that make the experience undesirable. User pain points can be minor inconveinences to major issues preventing users from accessing the product or service entirely. Identifying and resolving these issues is a crucial part of web development and should be considered throughout any project. Pain points are commonly described in three levels with four types at each level

## Pain Point Levels

- `Interaction`: User's interaction with product or support
- `Journey`: The steps it takes a user to complete a task
- `Relationship`: User's lifetime experience with a product or brand 

## Pain Point Types

- `Financial`: relates to paywalls and subscription services that lock a user out.
- `Product`: relates to the performance, quality, and usability issues while using a product
- `Process`: relates to the steps required to complete a task
- `Support`: relates to how organizations respond to user questions
