A logo is a symbol, graphic, or emblem, that is used to represent a company, product, or brand. A logo presents a unique opportunity for companies to stand out and create a brand identity that assists in brand recognition. Additionally, the color of a logo plays a significant role in how a brand is perceived based on the emotional response it creates.

Companies such as [Google](https://www.google.com), [Nike](https://www.nike.com), [Apple](https://www.apple.com), [McDonaldâ€™s](https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us.html), and, last but not least, [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com), are several logos that are recognized around the world.
