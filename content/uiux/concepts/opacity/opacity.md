An object with high opacity has low transparency, meaning little or no light can pass through. 

If an object is completely opaque, like a solid wood door, no light can pass through, and anything behind the door will not be visible. In contrast, a partially opaque object, like a window covered by a thin curtain, allows light to pass through, and objects behind the window will be somewhat visible. 

In [design software](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/design-software), the [fill](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/uiux/fill) typically defaults to 100% opacity. As the opacity is lowered, the layer will become more transparent, and any colors or shapes behind the layer will become visible.
