A wireframe is a low-fidelity representation of a digital interface that defines the content layout and page elements.

Wireframes are meant to show an idea, or proof of concept, without investing too much time and resources. Wireframes can be sketched or created in [design software](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/design-software) (such as [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)). It is important to remember that when creating wireframes not to dwell on cosmetic elements like [font](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/text-properties), colors, [imagery](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/images), and even accurate spacing.

The rough draft nature of wireframes helps determine a solution for the structure ([information architecture](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/information-architecture) and [interaction design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/interaction-design)) and skeleton ([interface design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/interface-design), [navigation design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/navigation-design), [information design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/information-design)) layers of the [Five Elements of UX Design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/five-elements-of-ux-design).
