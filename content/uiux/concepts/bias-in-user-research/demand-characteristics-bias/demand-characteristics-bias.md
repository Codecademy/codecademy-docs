**Demand characteristics bias** is a change in how a user answers questions due to the knowledge that they are part of a research study. If the user knows, or thinks they know, the objective of a study, this could influence their responses and behaviors.

## Example

A researcher runs a concept test to evaluate an early design idea. The participant may believe that the goal is to validate the idea so the company can move on to the development phase. This belief could influence them to try to “help” the researcher. They might provide positive feedback even if they don’t like the idea.
