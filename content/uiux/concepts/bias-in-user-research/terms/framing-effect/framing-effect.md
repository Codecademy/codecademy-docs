The **framing effect** occurs when findings are presented in a way that is disingenuous. Examples of the framing effect could be excluding certain data points, using statistical measures that are skewed, or strategically phrasing an insight to imply a certain idea or opinion. Researchers should present the data in a way that accurately represents respondentsâ€™ statements.

## Example

Imagine that 20 survey respondents rated their overall approval of a certain product on a Likert scale of 1 to 5.

The researcher reports that the average approval rate is between 2 and 3, meaning that users are slightly dissatisfied. Considering that the mean is 2.45, this is technically correct. But it is a disingenuous finding &mdash; only 25% of the users actually rated the product between a 2 and a 3.

It would be more accurate to report that the majority of users are either extremely dissatisfied or extremely satisfied with the product. By reporting the finding that the approval rate is between 2 and 3, the team might miss the root of the issue that causes disparities in the satisfaction of certain groups of users.
