**User research** is the identification, observation, and study of target users and their behaviors. User research can affect decisions across an organization: which products are developed, what they look like, and how they are sold. Regular user research is also part of a robust [iterative design process](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/iterative-process), helping designers test and evaluate UI/UX changes.

##User Research Considerations

- Designers must consider whether they working with **qualitative** or **quantitative** data. [Quantitative research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/quantitative-research) data can be expressed numerically, such as "75% of users who reach this page exit the site" or "65% of survey respondents are men aged 30-45." Quantitative research can take the form of site tracking, closed-ended survey questions, or behavioral assessment, among other methodologies. [Qualitative research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/qualitative-research) data typically expresses judgment or evaluation from individual respondents. A qualitative report might read "User expressed difficulty discerning text from background with color combination A" or "researcher observed user frustration trying to access feature B." Designers seeking qualitative data can utilize interviews, open-ended survey questions, or a number of other methodologies. Quantitative research paints a clearer, more reliable picture of a userbase and its behaviors, while qualitative research allows for more in-depth explanation of those behaviors. Effective researchers will use a variety of methodologies to identify and solve user problems.
- When creating user research studies, designers will also consider whether they want to perform **attitudinal** or **behavioral** research. [Attitudinal research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/attitudinal-research) relies on self-reported data to discern users' opinions or preferences, while [behavioral research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/behavioral-research) observes user actions, either in real use cases or in controlled environments. Attitudinal research allows researchers to gather *more* information; they might ask clarifying questions to further discussion in a focus group, or they might include open-ended questions about reasons behind user preference in a survey. Behavioral research allows researchers to gather *reliable* information; users may respond one way when considering a hypothetical but behave differently when using the product themselves. Both types of research can provide valuable insight in making design decisions.
- Within behavioral research, designers must also consider whether they will study **observed behavior** or **prompted behavior**, also referred to as **scripted behavior**. Observed behavioral data is typically collected by studying actual user actions in a product that's already been launched, with as little interference as possible from the researchers. For example, tracking cookies on a website can record a full user journey, from how they originally navigated to the site to what page they were visiting when they exited. Prompted behavioral data is collected in more controlled settings, where researchers might give study participants a goal, such as "purchase X item with discount code XYZ" or "navigate to ABC feature from the home page," while noting detailed behavior and feedback. Observed behavior can more reliably predict future user actions, while prompted behavior gives a more granular view of user actions and attitudes.
- Designers and researchers should also keep participant selection in mind when planning a user study. User surveys, focus groups, and similar methodologies will always be subject to **selection bias**, a phenomenon in which the population of users willing to participate in the study are not representative of the userbase as a whole. Concerns around participant selection will also include scaling and privacy. Generally, the more participants a study has, the more representative it will be of the whole userbase, and the better it will be at predicting future behavior; however, the more participants a study has, the more resources it will require, and researchers often find themselves working around time and funding limitations. Privacy becomes a sliding concern with today's advanced tracking tools. Cookies may provide detailed user demographics, or heatmap plugins might give insights into granular cursor behaviors, but some users find these tools invasive. Researchers will find themselves having to balance their organization's data requirements with its values and ethics.

##Benefits and Shortcomings
- Usability/accessibility improvements at user pain points
- Explicitly documented common goals across teams
- Conversion focus versus value focus confuses product vision
- User feedback limitations (Henry Ford's "If I had asked my customers what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse."
