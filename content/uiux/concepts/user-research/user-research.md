**User research** is the identification, observation, and study of target users and their behaviors. User research can affect decisions across an organization: which products are developed, what they look like, and how they are sold. Regular user research is also part of a robust [iterative design process](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/iterative-process), helping designers test and evaluate UI/UX changes.
