**User research** is the identification, observation, and study of target users and their behaviors. User research can affect decisions across an organization: which products are developed, what they look like, and how they are sold. Regular user research is also part of a robust [iterative design process](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/iterative-process), helping designers test and evaluate UI/UX changes.

##User Research Process
1. **Planning:** The first step in performing user research should be to establish a [research plan](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/research-plan). Here, the team will determine and document what information they need, why the team needs this data, and how it will be obtained. Organizational considerations like scope, timelines, and deliverables should also be established during this phase, and all stakeholders should be identified and informed. 
2. **Execution:** Here, the research team will use the appropriate methodologies determined in the planning phase to gather data on target users. These methodologies might include [user surveys](https://codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/surveys), used to send question sets to large groups of users, [focus groups](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/focus-groups), in which a moderator leads in-depth conversations with small groups of users, or any number of other avenues of data collection.
3. **Analysis:** After gathering large quantities of raw data, the user research team will evaluate the data for actionable insights, keeping in mind the goals established during planning. Researchers will first check the quality of the data: "Does it appear the users understood this survey question? Did this focus group stay on topic? Did this tracking tool function as expected?" They will then examine the data for trends or groupings that can be reasonably applied to the userbase at large: "Enterprise decision-makers among the userbase express ABC preference; X% of daily users exit the site at XYZ page." 
4. **Reporting:** Finally, researchers will translate their analyzed data into an easily-understandable [research-report](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/research-report). This report should also include a high-level summary of the execution process, and it should tie both the research findings and the research execution to the initial research plan.

##User Research Considerations

- Designers must consider whether they working with **qualitative** or **quantitative** data. [Quantitative research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/quantitative-research) data can be expressed numerically, such as "75% of users who reach this page exit the site" or "65% of survey respondents are men aged 30-45." Quantitative research can take the form of site tracking, closed-ended survey questions, or behavioral assessment, among other methodologies. [Qualitative research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/qualitative-research) data typically expresses judgment or evaluation from individual respondents. A qualitative report might read "User expressed difficulty discerning text from background with color combination A" or "researcher observed user frustration trying to access feature B." Designers seeking qualitative data can utilize interviews, open-ended survey questions, or a number of other methodologies. Quantitative research paints a clearer, more reliable picture of a userbase and its behaviors, while qualitative research allows for more in-depth explanation of those behaviors. Effective researchers will use a variety of methodologies to identify and solve user problems.
- When creating user research studies, designers will also consider whether they want to perform **attitudinal** or **behavioral** research. [Attitudinal research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/attitudinal-research) relies on self-reported data to discern users' opinions or preferences, while [behavioral research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/behavioral-research) observes user actions, either in real use cases or in controlled environments. Attitudinal research allows researchers to gather *more* information; they might ask clarifying questions to further discussion in a focus group, or they might include open-ended questions about reasons behind user preference in a survey. Behavioral research allows researchers to gather *reliable* information; users may respond one way when considering a hypothetical but behave differently when using the product themselves. Both types of research can provide valuable insight in making design decisions.
- Within behavioral research, designers must also consider whether they will study **observed behavior** or **prompted behavior**, also referred to as **scripted behavior**. Observed behavioral data is typically collected by studying actual user actions in a product that's already been launched, with as little interference as possible from the researchers. For example, tracking cookies on a website can record a full user journey, from how they originally navigated to the site to what page they were visiting when they exited. Prompted behavioral data is collected in more controlled settings, where researchers might give study participants a goal, such as "purchase X item with discount code XYZ" or "navigate to ABC feature from the home page," while noting detailed behavior and feedback. Observed behavior can more reliably predict future user actions, while prompted behavior gives a more granular view of user actions and attitudes.
- Designers and researchers should also keep participant selection in mind when planning a user study. User surveys, focus groups, and similar methodologies will always be subject to **selection bias**, a phenomenon in which the population of users willing to participate in the study are not representative of the userbase as a whole. Concerns around participant selection will also include scaling and privacy. Generally, the more participants a study has, the more representative it will be of the whole userbase, and the better it will be at predicting future behavior; however, the more participants a study has, the more resources it will require, and researchers often find themselves working around time and funding limitations. Privacy becomes a sliding concern with today's advanced tracking tools. Cookies may provide detailed user demographics, or heatmap plugins might give insights into granular cursor behaviors, but some users find these tools invasive. Researchers will find themselves having to balance their organization's data requirements with its values and ethics.

##User Research Results and Products
An important skill for user researchers to cultivate is the ability to translate raw data into easily-digestible information and actionable insights. **Data visualization** is a major part of that skillset, in which the research team uses visual design tools like charts and graphs to communicate this information at varying levels of depth. Research teams may also generate user [personas](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/persona) and [user stories](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/user-story), tools that serve as useful shorthand references for designers, developers, and marketers.

##Benefits and Shortcomings
- Usability/accessibility improvements at user pain points
- Explicitly documented common goals across teams
- Conversion focus versus value focus confuses product vision
- User feedback limitations (Henry Ford's "If I had asked my customers what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse."
)
