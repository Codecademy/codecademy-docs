**Width** is the horizontal measurement of an object and **height** is the vertical measurement. Width and height are listed together like this: 500 x 600. The first value is width, the “x” is read as “by,” and the second value is height.

Design software displays the height and width of each layer that’s added to the design. Units of measurement vary across design software, but pixels or points are commonly used to measure a layer’s dimensions. For more information, check out this [article about pixels vs. points](https://anydifferencebetween.com/difference-between-pixel-and-point/) and this [resource about pixel density](https://material.io/design/layout/pixel-density.html).
