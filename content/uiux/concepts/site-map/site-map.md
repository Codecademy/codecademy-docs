A site map is a high-level representation of [content hierarchy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/content-hierarchy) within a digital interface. Site maps define all pages that need to be built and how the content will be organized.

![Information Architecture - Site Map example](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/intro-to-ui-and-ux/wireframes/information-architecture.svg)

The site map example features an assortment of tiered blocks interconnected with lines. The blocks represent pages, and the lines represent hierarchical relationships between specific pages. The [homepage](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/homepage) in this example is at the top of the site map and encompasses the catalog, resources, and community pages. Challenges, articles, videos, and projects are sub-pages under the resources page.
