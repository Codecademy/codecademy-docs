The color picker can be used to update a layer’s [fill](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/uiux/fill) and [stroke](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/uiux/stroke).  

## Selecting Colors

While color pickers vary across platforms, they typically include multiple options for selecting a color.

* _Color Picker_: The color picker displays a hue and variations of its light and dark shades &mdash different hues can be accessed by adjusting the slider. A color can be selected by moving the white circle to the desired color on the color picker. 

* _Eyedropper Tool_: The eyedropper tool can be used to select colors that are in the design file. For example, the eyedropper can select colors from an image in the design file.

* _Color Model_: Each color has a notation that correlates to a color model, such as HEX, RGB, and HSL. Entering a notation, such as a HEX code, is another way to select a color from the color picker. In collaborative projects, color notations are included in design documentation to ensure that the correct colors are consistently applied in the design and development phases. Check out [Figma’s resource about color models] (https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043042113) for more information.

* _Saved Colors_: Colors that are applied in the design file may be automatically saved in the color picker as “swatches” or “document colors”. Alternatively, the software may provide an option to save colors manually, so they can be readily accessed from the color picker.

## Adjusting Color Settings

The [opacity](https://codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/opacity) of a color often defaults to 100%, and color pickers typically provide a feature for adjusting the opacity.

The color picker often defaults to applying a _solid color_, where one color is consistently applied. Most design software also can apply a _gradient_ in various styles, such as linear, radial, and diamond, where two or more colors are blended together.
