_User-centered design (UCD)_ is a [design methodology](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/design-methodologies) consisting of an iterative process that puts users at the center of product development and involves them in the design from the beginning. User-centered design processes generally involve the following activities: understand, specify, design, and evaluate.

User-centered design responds to both contexts of use (such as the user's environment, technology, and emotional state) and business goals. While user-centered design processes may define the steps differently, they generally involve the following activities:

1. **Understand**: Empathize with the user.
2. **Specify**: Hone in on a specific problem to solve.
3. **Design**: Brainstorm and develop solutions.
4. **Evaluate**: Test the product or prototypes to assess success and incorporate feedback.
