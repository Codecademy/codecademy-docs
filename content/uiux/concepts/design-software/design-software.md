Design software is useful when creating user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) deliverables such as [wireframes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/wireframe), interactive prototypes, [personas](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/persona), [user journey maps](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/user-journey-map), and [site maps](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/site-map), to name a few.

Popular design software, such as [Figma](https://www.figma.com), [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com), and [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) are commonly used to create [high-fidelity](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/high-fidelity) wireframes and prototypes.
