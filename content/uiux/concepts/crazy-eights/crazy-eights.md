**Crazy Eights's** is a core Design Sprint method. It is a fast sketching exercise that challenges people to sketch eight distinct ideas in eight minutes. The goal is to push beyond your first idea, which is frequently the basic(least innovative), and to generate a wide variety of solutions to your design(challenge).

#### Example  
To properly implement the crazy eight method would be to 1st begin with an idea in mind for your design then setting a 8minute timer and folding a piece of paper 3 times so that you have eight boxes you then start the timer begin sketching and spend no more than 1 minute per box. Do this with other members in your team the more the ideas the better since this is just the drafting stage.
