A **comment** is a piece of text within a program that is not executed. It is used to provide additional information or to explain the purpose of the code for better understanding.

### Single-line Comments
For single-line comments, the compiler ignores any text after two consecutive forward slashes (`//`) on the same line.

```cs
// This is a single-line comment
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!"); // Inline comment
```

### Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments begin with `/*` and end with `*/`. The compiler ignores any text in between.

```cs
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
It spans multiple lines
and is ignored by the compiler.
*/
Console.WriteLine("This line will run.");
```

### Example

The following examples show various comment styles:

```cs
// Single-line comment
Console.WriteLine("This is a single-line comment.");

/*
Multi-line comment explaining a block of code
*/
Console.WriteLine("This is part of the program.");
```

### XML Comments

[XML](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/xml) comments are structured comments that produce [API](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/api) documentation. The C# compiler generates an XML file containing these comments, which can be used to create documentation like web pages or PDFs.

#### Syntax

The following is a single-line XML comment, which uses three forward slashes (`///`):

```cs
/// This is a single-line XML comment

/**
 * This is a multi-line XML comment.
 * It provides documentation for code elements.
 */
```

Multi-line XML comments are similar to regular multi-line comments, except that an extra asterisk `*` is used in the opening:

```cs
/**
 * This is a multi-line XML comment.
 * It provides documentation for code elements.
 */
```

#### Example

XML tags embedded in XML comments are used to signal a specific functionality of the XML comment to the compiler. The `<summary>` tag in the following example describes a type or a member, in this case, the public class `MyClass`:

```cs
/// <summary>
/// This class performs an important function.
/// </summary>
public class MyClass {
    /// <summary>
    /// This method performs a calculation.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="a">First number</param>
    /// <param name="b">Second number</param>
    /// <returns>The sum of a and b</returns>
    public int Add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b; // Returns the result
    }
}
```

### **Fixes Applied**
- **Closed All Code Blocks**: Missing ` ``` ` closures were added where needed.
- **Headings Fixed**: Corrected nesting of headings outside of code blocks.
- **Markdown Compliance**: Ensured valid Markdown structure.
- **Improved Readability**: Refined text explanations and examples.
