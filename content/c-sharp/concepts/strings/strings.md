A **`string`** is an instance of the `System.String` object in C# and represents an immutable sequence of `Char` objects. Unlike other languages, there's no null-terminating character at the end of a C# string, so a C# string can contain embedded null characters. The `string` keyword in C# is an alias for `System.String` and can be used even without `using System;`.
