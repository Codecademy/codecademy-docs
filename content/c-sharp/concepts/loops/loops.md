A **loop** is a logical structure used in [C#](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/c-sharp) to repeatedly execute a block of code. This repetition can either iterate an exact number of times (definite) or continuously until a condition is met (indefinite).

## For Loop

In C# the `for` loop uses definite repetition to run a block of code a specified number of times and consists of three statements.

```pseudo
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3)
{
  //your code here
}
```

## While Loop

## Do While Loop
