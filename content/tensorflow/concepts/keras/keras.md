**Keras** is a high-level library used with TensorFlow in Python. It is used to create deep learning and neural network models. The purpose of this library is to allow developers to build machine learning applications efficiently.

## Foundations of Keras

The base of Keras is layers and models. It allows to perform every step in building a model. That includes loading and cleaning the dataset, stacking layers to create models, evaluating model output, etc.

To start building with functions within keras, the following is used:

```pseudo
tf.keras.relevantFunction()
```

Considering `tensorflow` is imported as `tf` and `relevantFunction()` is a function provided within the `keras` module in TensorFlow.
