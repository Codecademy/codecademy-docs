Everything in PowerShell is an **object**. An object is a combination of variables and functions.  Each object has:

- **Properties**: variables that describe the object (characteristics)
- **Methods**: functions that describe how to use the object (actions)

Each object is an instance of a blueprint called a *type*, or *[class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming))*. 

## Getting Properties and Methods of an Object

All information associated with an object is called a member. The `Get-Member` cmdlet reveals the member of an object â€“ properties, methods, and so on. It also shows the type of an object.

```PowerShell
$dog | Get-Member
```

## Object Properties

Properties, or attributes, are characteristics of an object. String objects, for example, have a property called `Length` which holds the number of characters in a string.

```PowerShell
PS > "hello".Length # "hello" has 5 characters
5
```


The `Get-Member` cmdlet can be utilized with the `MemberType` parameter to only show the properties of an object. Consider a script file:
```PowerShell
Get-ChildItem .\script.ps1 | Get-Member -MemberType Property # Shows all properties of the script
(Get-ChildItem .\script.ps1).CreationTime # Prints the date when the script was created
```

## Object Methods

Methods are the actions an object can take. One of the methods of a String object, for example, is `Contains()`. This method returns `True` if a string contains the specified substring, otherwise `False`.

```PowerShell
PS > $my_string = "codecademy"
PS > $my_string.Contains("code")
True
```

`MemberType` parameter of the `Get-Member` cmdlet can be modified to show only the methods of an object.

```PowerShell
$dog | Get-Member -MemberType Method # Shows all methods of the dog object
```

## Creating a Custom Object

PowerShell allows the creation of custom objects. To create a custom object called `dog`, we use the `New-Object` cmdlet with the `PSCustomObject` type name.

```PowerShell
$dog = New-Object -TypeName PSCustomObject
```

By default, new custom objects have no properties and four methods.

### Adding Properties
To add properties to custom objects, use the `Add-Member` cmdlet. A type of member must be specified. For a simple key-value pair, we use `NoteProperty` but there are [many kinds of properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/ets/properties?view=powershell-7.3).
```PowerShell
$dog | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "Name" -Value "Rufus"
```

`-Name` is used to specify the name of the property and `-Value` is used to specify the value to be assigned.

### Adding Methods
Adding methods to custom objects is similar to adding properties but `ScriptMethod` is specified for the `MemberType` parameter. However, there are [several method types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/add-member?view=powershell-7.3#-membertype) available.

A piece of code encapsulated within curly braces `{ }` called `ScriptBlock` is also needed. In the example below, a script block called `speak` is first defined and then added as a method to the `dog` custom object.

```PowerShell
$speak = {
    "Woof!"
}

$dog | Add-Member -MemberType ScriptMethod -Name "speak" -Value $speak
```

### Using a Hashtable

An alternative method to creating a custom object is by utilizing a hashtable. A hashtable defines multiple key-value pairs which can be used to easily add properties to a custom object.

```PowerShell
$dog = [PSCustomObject]@{ # Creates a custom object called dog
    Name = "Rufus" # Adds a Name property with "Rufus" as its value
    Age = 10       # Adds a Age property with 10 as its value
}
```
