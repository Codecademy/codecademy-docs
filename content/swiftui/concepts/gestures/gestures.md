Views can respond to your tap,drags,pinches and other gestures. Just by adding **Gesture** modifer to your View.

## Tap Gestures

This is the most basic type of Gestures. Implementing tap gesture is pretty easy. 
You can call `.onTapGesture()` modifier on the view you want to track gesture on.

```Swift
Text("Hello, World!") // SwiftUI Text view.
            .onTapGesture { // by using this modifier, you can run a specifec action when the View is tapped.
                print("View Tapped") // this function will print "View Tapped" in the console.
            }

```
**Output**:

```Shell
View Tapped 
```

In the above example, everytime you tap the text view "Hello, World", it prints "View Tapped" in the console.
You can also implement the action after certain amount of tap gestures. For example:

```Swift
Text("Hello, World!") // SwiftUI Text view.
            .onTapGesture(count: 3) { // by using this modifier, you can run a specifec action when the View is tapped 3 times.
                print("View Tapped") // this function will print "View Tapped" in the console.
            }
```
**Output**:

```Shell
View Tapped
```
In this example it prints "View Tapped" after taping the text view for three times.
 
> Important note: When you need a button, use a Button instance rather than a tap gesture. You can use any view as the buttonâ€™s label, and the button type automatically provides many of the standard behaviors that users expect from a button, like accessibility labels and hints. 


## Long Press Gestures
`onLongPressGesture()` it's used for handling long presses. Like `.onTapGesture()`, `onLongPressGesture()` is also customizable. For example, you can specify a minimum duration for the press, so your action closure only triggers after a specific number of seconds have passed. For example, this will trigger only after two seconds:

```Swift
Text("Hello, World!") // SwiftUI Text view.
            .onLongPressGesture(minimumDuration: 2) { // by using this modifier, you can run a specifec action after pressing the text view for 2 seconds.
                print("Long pressed!") // this function will print "View Tapped" in the console.
            }
```
