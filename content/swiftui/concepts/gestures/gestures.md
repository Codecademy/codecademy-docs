Views can respond to taps, drags, pinches and other gestures just by adding **Gesture** modifiers to your View.

## Tap Gestures

This is the most basic type of Gesture.
The `.onTapGesture()` modifier can be called on the view desired to track the gesture on.

```Swift
Text("Hello, World!") // SwiftUI Text view.
            .onTapGesture { // Using this modifier, a specific action can be run when the View is tapped.

                print("View Tapped") // This function will print "View Tapped" in the console.

            }

```

This example will output the following when the view is tapped:

```Shell
View Tapped 
```

In the above example, every time the text view "Hello, World" is tapped, it prints "View Tapped" in the console.
The action can also be implemented after certain amount of tap gestures. For example:

```Swift
Text("Hello, World!") // SwiftUI Text view.
            .onTapGesture(count: 3) { // By using this modifier, a specific action can be run when the View is tapped 3 times.

                print("View Tapped") // This function will print "View Tapped" in the console.

            }
```
**Output**:

```Shell
View Tapped
```
In this example it prints "View Tapped" after taping the text view three times.

 
> **Note:** When a button is needed, use a Button instance rather than a tap gesture. Any view can be used as the buttonâ€™s label, and the button type automatically provides many of the standard behaviors that users expect from a button, like accessibility labels and hints. 

## Long Press Gestures

`onLongPressGesture()` it's used for handling long presses. Like `.onTapGesture()`, `onLongPressGesture()` is also customizable. For example, a minimum duration for the press can be specified, so your action closure only triggers after a specific number of seconds have passed. For example, this will trigger only after two seconds:

```Swift
Text("Hello, World!") // SwiftUI Text view.
            .onLongPressGesture(minimumDuration: 2) { // Dy using this modifier, a specific action can be run after pressing the text view for 2 seconds.

                print("Long pressed!") // this function will print "View Tapped" in the console.
            }
```


## Advanced Gestures

For more advanced gestures the `gesture()` modifier should be used with one of the gesture structs: `DragGesture`, `LongPressGesture`, `MagnificationGesture`, `RotationGesture`, and `TapGesture`. These all have special modifiers, usually `onEnded()` and often `onChanged() `too, and they can be used to take action when the gestures are in-flight (for `onChanged()`) or completed (`for onEnded()`).


As an example, a magnification gesture could be attached to a view so that pinching in and out scales the view up and down. This can be done by creating two `@State` properties to store the scale amount, using that inside a `scaleEffect()` modifier, then setting those values in the gesture, like this:

```Swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var currentAmount = 0.0
    @State private var finalAmount = 1.0

    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .scaleEffect(finalAmount + currentAmount)
            .gesture(
                MagnificationGesture()
                    .onChanged { amount in
                        currentAmount = amount - 1
                    }
                    .onEnded { amount in
                        finalAmount += currentAmount 
                        currentAmount = 0
                    }
            )
    }
}
```
