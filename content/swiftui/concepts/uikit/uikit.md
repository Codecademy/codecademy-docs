## UIKit

UIKit is a foundational framework for building user interfaces in iOS and iPadOS applications. It provides a comprehensive set of components and tools that enable developers to create visually appealing and interactive user interfaces. UIKit has been the primary framework for building iOS apps for many years and continues to be widely used.

### Relation to SwiftUI

With the introduction of SwiftUI, a declarative framework for building user interfaces, UIKit remains an essential part of the iOS development ecosystem. While SwiftUI offers a modern and intuitive way to design interfaces, UIKit provides a robust and mature set of APIs that SwiftUI can leverage. This allows developers to combine the power of both frameworks, using UIKit for certain UI components or integrating existing UIKit-based code into SwiftUI projects.

### WidgetKit Overview

WidgetKit is a framework introduced in iOS 14 that allows developers to create interactive and dynamic widgets for the home screen. While WidgetKit is primarily associated with SwiftUI, it also integrates with UIKit. Developers can use WidgetKit with UIKit to create widgets using existing UIKit-based UI components or to enhance their existing UIKit applications with home screen widgets. This integration provides flexibility for developers, enabling them to leverage the strengths of both UIKit and WidgetKit to create engaging and personalized experiences for users.
