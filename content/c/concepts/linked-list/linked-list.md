A **linked list** is a type of linear data structure in which elements are not stored sequentially but are dynamically allocated in memory, consisting of small units called nodes. These units connect and point to other nodes to create a linked list.

The structure of a node is illustrated below:

Each node in a linked list has two parts:

- `data`: It stores the value, which can be of any data type.
- `next`: A pointer that stores the memory address of the next node in the sequence.

When nodes are connected to one other, a linked list is formed, as shown below:

A linked list consists of two key components:

- `Head`: The first node in the linked list.
- `Tail`: The last node in the linked list, which points to `NULL` in a singly linked list.

There are four types of linked list:

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Doubly Circular linked list
