TypeScript is three tools that build on each other:

1. A **language** specification that describes JavaScript syntax as well as new TypeScript-specific syntax
2. A **compiler** program that takes in TypeScript (and therefore also JavaScript) syntax and converts it to the equivalent JavaScript
3. A **type checker** program that reads in TypeScript syntax, understands the types of values every entity is meant to be, and notices any "type errors" (mismatches)
4. A **language server** that editors such as VS Code can run to provide development-time hints and refactoring tools

You can get started with an interactive playground provided by the TypeScript team at: https://www.typescriptlang.org/play.

It allows you to type in JavaScript or TypeScript code on the left and see the resultant output JavaScript or any TypeScript type errors.
