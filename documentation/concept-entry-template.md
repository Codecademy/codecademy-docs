**Table** View in SwiftUI is a structure that allows us to create and present rows of data arranged in multiple columns. Table View is a great option for displaying a collection of data in a compact form. Many datasets have a tabular structure and can be efficiently presented in a table format. If the number of rows exceeds the available space, the Table will enable vertical scrolling automatically. Additionally, on macOS, horizontal scrolling is available when the number of columns exceeds the view's width.
