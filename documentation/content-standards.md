# Content Standards

### Entry Types
Codepedia content will fall into two categories:

#### Encyclopedia Entries
One or more paragraph-long explanations of a coding concept. Think of them like short Wikipedia pages.
  - For a model example, check out [What Is a Comment?](https://github.com/Codecademy/codepedia-content/blob/main/content/language-agnostic/encyclopedia/what-is-a-comment.md) 
 
#### Glossary Entries
Short lists of key information about a specific function, keyword, tag, or other grouping. Glossary entries will be grouped into _glossaries_, or tables of glossary entries on the same subject
  - For a model example, check out [the .append() entry in the Python List Methods glossary](https://github.com/Codecademy/codepedia-content/tree/main/content/python/glossaries/list-methods).

### Relation between Entries  
As a general rule, any given topic should be described by multiple entries in the following structure:
  - 1 language-agnostic encyclopedia entry defining topic X in a general way. Entitled "What is X?".
    -  Example: [What Is a Comment?](https://github.com/Codecademy/codepedia-content/blob/main/content/language-agnostic/encyclopedia/what-is-a-comment.md) 
  - Multiple language-specific encyclopedia entries explaining the syntax and nuances of topic X for a given language. Entitled "X in \<language>".
    - Example: [Comments in Python](https://github.com/Codecademy/codepedia-content/blob/main/content/python/encyclopedia/comments-in-python.md) 
  - Where applicable, 1 or more Glossaries describing the methods and keywords in a language that relate to topic X
    - Example: The [List Methods glossary for Python](https://github.com/Codecademy/codepedia-content/tree/main/content/python/glossaries/list-methods). (Note: This example is not related to the What is a Comment? and Comments in Python encyclopedia entries).  

Notably, this structure means that you do not have to explain any language-agnostic concepts in an "X in \<language>" encyclopedia entryâ€”the reader can read the "What is X" entry to learn that!

### Components of an Entry

All Codepedia entries are Markdown files and should consist of three parts:

- **The file name**
- **The content**, written in Markdown.
- **The metadata** about the content, written in YAML, which appears at the top of the entry.

We'll describe the standards for each of these components separately.

### Standards for the File Name 

The file name should be the title of the entry, in lowercase, with words replaced by dashes and punctuation removed, followed by ``.md``. So, to give an example, an encylopedia entry titled "How to Create a Codepedia Entry?" should have the file name ``how-to-create-a-codepedia-entry.md``. 

### Standards for the Content 

- All text should be written in Markdown
  - For more details on Markdown, see Codecademy's [Curriculum Markdown Style Guide](http://curriculum-documentation.codecademy.com/content-guidelines/markdown-style-guide/).
- Each subsection should begin with a heading of size H2 (i.e. preceded by "## ")
- All in-line code should be delineated by single backticks (`)

#### Code Blocks
Code examples are an excellent teaching  tool. Many glossary entry types will contain a code example as a standard field. Encyclopedia entries are more flexible, but if your encyclopedia entry doesn't contain any code blocks, take a moment to ask yourself if one would help!
All code blocks should be delineated by triple backticks (```)
- C#: ```cs
- C++: ```cpp
- CSS: ```css
- Error: ```error
- Emojicode: ```emojic
- HTML: ```html
- Java: ```java
- JavaScript: ```js
- PHP: ```php
- Pseudo: ```pseudo
- Python: ```py
- R: ```r
- Ruby: ```rb
- Sass: ```scss
- Shell/Program Output: ```
- SQL: ```sql

#### Runnable Code Blocks
Codecademy has an upcoming feature we're calling _Codebytes_ that will allow learners to click a button to run and see the output of a code block embedded anywhere on our site. We're excited about this feature, and we highly recommend using it wherever you can!

The syntax is simple. Here's an example for pseudocode:

````pseudo
<codebyte>
```pseudo
code!
```
</codebyte>
````
Currently, Codebytes is set to support the following languages:
- Python
- JavaScript
- Ruby
- C++
- C#
- Go
- PHP

### Standards for the Metadata 

| Variable Name   | Description | Example |
|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| Subjects        | Languages and technical fields that the entry relates to. We're storing all of our Subjects in the [subjects.md file](https://github.com/Codecademy/codepedia-content/blob/main/documentation/subjects.md). Please only use Subjects from that list, but if that list feels insufficient, feel free to create a new Subject and add it to subjects.md in your PR!<br /> - We aim to include an average of 1-2 Subjects (and always at least 1!) with every entry | Subjects:<br /> - "computer science"<br /> - "game development" |
| Tags            | Key words that are relevant to the entry. We're storing all of our Tags in the [tags.md file](https://github.com/Codecademy/codepedia-content/blob/main/documentation/tags.md). Please only use Tags from that list, but if that list feels insufficient, feel free to create a new Tag and add it to tags.md in your PR!<br /> - We aim to include an average of 3 - 4 tags with every entry. | Tags:<br /> - "react"<br />  - "url"<br />    - "string"<br /> - "syntax" |
| Catalog Content | URL(s) of Codecademy course and path landing pages that relate to the entry.<br /> - Please avoid linking to individual content items, because their URLs may change and some are gated by Pro membership<br /> - If including multiple URLs, please list the most relevant one first. | Catalog Content:<br /> - "https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript"<br /> - "https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path" |      


### General Writing Tips:

- Avoid referencing information that isn't strictly related to the topic of the entry. As a rule, you want to assume as little pre-existing knowledge as possible. 
- Avoid using first- and second-person pronouns (e.g. I, we, you) if possible.
- Brevity without sacrificing clarity. Make every word count.
- If the concept is hard, make it easy. If it's dry, make it fun. If it's simple, keep it simple.
- 90% of writing is rewriting.

### File Hosting
If you'd like to include an image, video, gif, or other file in your entry, please upload it to the [media-file-hosting folder](https://github.com/Codecademy/codepedia-content/tree/main/media-file-hosting). That way we'll never have any broken links!

### I've read all the content standards. Now what?
Check out the [encyclopedia entry template](https://github.com/Codecademy/codepedia-content/blob/main/documentation/encyclopedia-entry-template.md) and  [glossary entry template](https://github.com/Codecademy/codepedia-content/blob/main/documentation/glossary-entry-template.md) in this folder. Then put your name next to an entry in [the assignment sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e31MNRVTo5VijcuPFjqWymw8_A1BbShGEW_LuCqXZZA/edit#gid=0) and submit your entry via a pull request!
