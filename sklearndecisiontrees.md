**Sklearn**, or **Scikit-learn**, is one of the few, [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source) machine learning library's for the [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python) language. One way that Sklearn demonstrates machine learning is by using a Decision tree. A decision tree is a tool that is used to make possible decisions based on certain conditions in the world of machine learning. It is a form of a hierarchical model that has a tree-like shape. This model can chart decisions, consequences, event outcomes, resource costs, and utilities. A decision tree has several key components. The root node at the top represents the entire dataset and initiates the data split. Decision nodes represent features used for further splitting, which have multiple branches that can determine possible outcomes. Leaf nodes or terminal nodes are the endpoints that represent final outcomes. These components form a hierarchical structure which can further determine guiding decisions based on data attributes.

## Computer Science

Sklearn demonstrates machine learning by using computer science languages such as Python. Python is a type of computer science language that is very popular in the computer science world.  Machine learning is also a branch of computer science and it ideally falls under the same category.

## Machine Learning

Sklearn is a open learn library that contains tools on machine learning. For example, a type of tool is a decision tree. Decision trees are  models that can chart decisions, consequences, event outcomes, resource costs, and utilities.
