**Sklearn**, or **Scikit-learn**, is one of the few, [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source) machine learning library's for the [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python) language. One way that Sklearn demonstrates machine learning is by using a Decision tree. A decision tree is a tool that is used to make possible decisions based on certain conditions in the world of machine learning. It is a form of a hierarchical model that has a tree-like shape. This model can chart decisions, consequences, event outcomes, resource costs, and utilities. A decision tree has several key components. The root node at the top represents the entire dataset and initiates the data split. Decision nodes represent features used for further splitting, which have multiple branches that can determine possible outcomes. Leaf nodes or terminal nodes are the endpoints that represent final outcomes. These components form a hierarchical structure which can further determine guiding decisions based on data attributes.
