# Codecademy Docs: Contribution Guide üë©‚Äçüíªüßë‚Äçüíª

Welcome to the [Codecademy Docs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs) GitHub repo! 

We are an open, inclusive, and passionate team of technologists and life-long learners around the world building free programming resources for a better tomorrow. For newcomers, contributing to an open-source project for the first time can be intimidating and overwhelming. Perhaps you‚Äôre a code newbie or maybe you‚Äôve been tinkering for years but haven‚Äôt found that special project yet. 

Good news, you are in the right place! Codecademy Docs is the perfect open-contribution project for you to get started. Every part of [Codecademy Docs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs) content (entries, documentation, and translations) is written by amazing creative coders like yourself. 

Thanks for your interest; we'd love to work with you! üíñ

## How do I contribute?

 There are many ways to contribute to Codecademy Docs:

- Submit a Pull Request to edit an existing entry.
- Submit a Pull Request to create a new entry.
- Submit a bug in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/issues).
- Give feedback in the [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqwAiV8C2EjXciqTvPFI-ABxkh9iyy7HL-hnr69GrRW99MiA/viewform).
- Join the [#CodecademyDocs](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CodecademyDocs) discussion on Twitter.

## How do I submit a Pull Request (PR)?

Contributing follows this workflow:

1. Fork this [project repository](https://github.com/codecademy/docs).
2. Clone the forked repository to your computer.
3. Create a branch.
4. Edit or create an entry and commit the changes.
5. Make a PR to merge your fork with this repo.

If you haven't gone through this workflow before, you can check out this [GitHub tutorial](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions#readme) (highly recommend) or [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgbCcBNZcdQ) to learn about how to make a PR from a fork using Git. 

Alternatively, if you'd prefer to keep things to the GitHub UI for now, you can follow the instructions in that video up to 1:18 to fork this repo. After that, you can create your entry in your fork using the UI and then make a PR by pressing this handy button:<br>

If you are uncomfortable using Git, you can also check out [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/RPagOAUx2SQ) to do this all using the GitHub Desktop app.

## What do I need to do before creating new entries? 

Before creating new entries, poke around the [/content](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/tree/main/content) folder. This is where all the content is stored.

Please read through the following in the [/documentation](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/tree/main/documentation) folder. In these links, you'll find a write-up of our standards for content and style:

- [Content Standards](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/documentation/content-standards.md)
- [Tags List](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/documentation/tags.md)
- [Subjects List](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/documentation/subjects.md)

And here, templates for creating your new entries.

| Template | GitHub Example | Docs Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Entry Template](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/documentation/entry-template.md) | [lists.md](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/content/python/concepts/lists/lists.md) ([Raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codecademy/docs/main/content/python/concepts/lists/lists.md)) | [Lists](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/lists) |

### Codecadmy Username

As a Codecademy Docs contributor, you have the opportunity to have your Codecademy username displayed on the side of the entry (this feature is coming in October)!

If you wish to have your name displayed in the entry, before making the PR, make sure that your Codecademy user profile and your GitHub are linked. You can stay anonymous by not linking them.

To link your Codecademy user profile to GitHub:

1. Go to your [Codecademy dashboard](https://www.codecademy.com/learn).
2. Click on your profile image in the top-right and then choose "Profile".
3. Then click "Edit Profile".
4. In the GitHub field, add your GitHub profile URL.

## Any tips for a Pull Request?

- Keep your PRs byte-sized. No more than 3 new entries per PR!
- All contributors must sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
- All required [status checks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks) are expected to pass in each PR.
- We require one approval from one [core team member](https://github.com/codecademy/docs#core-team) for each PR.
- Requested changes must be resolved before merging.
- Your entry will be deployed shortly after it is merged!

## What do we check for?

- Technical accuracy
- Formatting standards
- Typos/bugs
- Plagiarism
