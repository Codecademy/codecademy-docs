# Codecademy Docs: Contribution Guide 👩‍💻🧑‍💻

> Built by the community. Maintained by Codecademy. 🌎

Welcome to the [Codecademy Docs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs) GitHub repo!

We are an open and inclusive community of technologists and life-long learners around the world building free coding resources for a better tomorrow. Anyone can contribute and each person who does makes us stronger. Together we can continue to drive innovation on the web to serve the greater good. It starts here, with you.

For newcomers, contributing to open source for the first time can be scary and a little overwhelming. Perhaps you’re a code newbie or maybe you’ve been coding for a while but haven’t found a project you felt comfortable contributing to. Well, you are at the right place, because Codecademy Docs is the perfect open-contribution project for you to get started!

Every part of [Codecademy Docs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs) (entries, documentations, translations) are created by amazing creative folks like yourself. Please, join us!

## What do I need to do before contributing? 

Before contributing, poke around the [/content](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/tree/main/content) folder. This is where all the content is stored.

Please read through the following in the [/documentation](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/tree/main/documentation) folder. In these links, you'll find a write-up of our standards for content and style:

- [Content Standards](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/documentation/content-standards.md)
- [Tags List](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/documentation/tags.md)
- [Subjects List](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/documentation/subjects.md)

And here, templates for creating your own entries.

| Template | GitHub Example | Docs Example |

## How do I contribute?

There are different ways in which you can contribute:

- Creating a new entry.
- Editing an exisiting entry.

Contributing is as simple as:

1. Forking this repo.
2. Editing your fork.
    - Be sure to fetch the main branch shortly before you make your edits — this repo is constantly changing, and trying to merge too old of a fork can be a challenge!
3. Making a pull request to merge your fork with this repo.

If you haven't gone through this workflow before, you can check out [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgbCcBNZcdQ) to learn about how to make a pull request from a fork using Git. 

Alternatively, if you'd prefer to keep things to the GitHub UI for now, you can follow the instructions in that video up to 1:18 to fork this repo. After that, you can create your entry in your fork using the UI and then make a pull request by pressing this handy button:<br>

If you are uncomfortable using Git, you can also check out [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/RPagOAUx2SQ) to do this all using the GitHub Desktop app. Highly recommend!

## Pull Requests Tips

- Keep your PRs byte-sized. No more than 3 new entries per PR!
- All contributors must sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
- All required checks are expected to pass on each PR.
- We require one approval from one core team member for each PR.
- Requested changes must be resolved (with code or discussion) before merging.
- Your code will be deployed shortly after it is merged!

## Things We Check For

- Technical accuracy
- Formatting standards
- Typos/bugs
- Plagiarism
