# Contribution Guide üë©‚Äçüíªüßë‚Äçüíª

## What do I need to do before contributing? 

Before contributing, please read through the files in [/documentation](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/tree/main/documentation):

- Content Standards: https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/documentation/content-standards.md
- Templates:
  - Entry
  - Page Info
- Tags
- Subjects

There you'll find a write-up of our standards for content and style, as well as templates for creating your entries. Next, check out what entries need to be created in [the assignment sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e31MNRVTo5VijcuPFjqWymw8_A1BbShGEW_LuCqXZZA/edit#gid=0) and put your name next to one.

## How do I contribute?

Contributing is as simple as:

1. Forking this repo.
2. Editing your fork.
    - Be sure to fetch the main branch shortly before you make your edits‚Äîthis repo is constantly changing, and trying to merge too old of a fork can be a challenge!
3. Making a pull request to merge your fork with this repo.

If you haven't gone through this workflow before, you can check out [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgbCcBNZcdQ) to learn about how to make a pull request from a fork using Git. Alternatively, if you'd prefer to keep things to the GitHub UI for now, you can follow the instructions in that video up to 1:18 to fork this repo. After that, you can create your entry in your fork using the UI and then make a pull request by pressing this handy button:<br>

If you are uncomfortable using Git, you can also check out [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/RPagOAUx2SQ) to do this all using the GitHub Desktop app.
