# `strpos()`

The `strpos()` function in PHP is used to find the position of the first occurrence of a substring within a string. It returns the numeric position of the substring if found, and `false` if the substring is not present in the given string.

## Syntax

```php
int|false strpos ( string $haystack , mixed $needle [, int $offset = 0 ] )

The strpos() function takes three parameters:

$haystack: The string to search within.
$needle: The substring to search for.
$offset (optional): An optional parameter to specify the position within the $haystack string to start the search. If provided, the function starts searching from that position. The default value is 0.

$string = "Hello, world!";
$substring = "world";

$position = strpos($string, $substring);
if ($position !== false) {
    echo "The substring '$substring' was found at position $position.";
} else {
    echo "The substring '$substring' was not found in the string.";
}

Output:
The substring 'world' was found at position 7.

Runnable Example
$string = "Hello, world!";
$substring = "world";

$position = strpos($string, $substring);
if ($position !== false) {
    echo "The substring '$substring' was found at position $position.";
} else {
    echo "The substring '$substring' was not found in the string.";
}
